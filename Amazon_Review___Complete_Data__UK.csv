Diamondmask,5.0 out of 5 stars,My First Kindle - Loving It,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2021,"This Paperwhite is a revelation as my first kindle. Its so light and easy to read with, especially in bed. I am a convert - this is my first ever kindle and there is no going back. Teamed with Kindle Unlimited - its totally brilliant. Just plug it in to charge and way you go. A Goodreads account is offered - I already had one but it took ages to connect to my Kindle, but the first time round while the Kindle is waking up may just be a one-off. The bookmark is also a little sluggish but I think I'm used to the quick response of my laptop so I may be spoiled."
Penelope A. Wythes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Loved my last one, love this one too",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2020,"Only criticism is that I was replacing an exactly similar Kindle only 18 months old.My previous Kindles have lasted much longer - in fact I still have them and they work. I replaced them for newer models with facets that that appealed. My previous Paperwhite however just died suddenly for no apparent reason - working fine one evening, low on charge so left on charge overnight - next day simply wouldn't work. Tried all sorts but it wouldn't resuscitate. Rapidly mobilised an old one, ordered a new one as I do like the Paperwhite. I'll see how this one lasts."
STUART MOSS,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very good - better for right handed people though!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 August 2019,"First the bad:A) Unlike my old Kindle (with the keyboard that I got in 2011 ish) the books seem harder to organise. It seems impossible to now group them all in a ‘file’ (by author) so that the ones you have read are not in the main menu, thus keeping the unread ones separate.B) If you are left handed, you might (like me) find it bloody annoying that you can’t swap round the areas of the touch screen where you turn the page. I hold my books in my left hand and want to use that same hand to turn the page, not have to use my other hand. Yes, yes, I know... ‘first world problems’! Ha! Ha!The Good:A) It is lighter than my old one.B) Love the back lit screen.C) Once you have gotten used to the touch screen (that is a little bit slow) and remembered what every part of the screen does, it is actually an improvement on my old Kindle."
Lilly,2.0 out of 5 stars,Worked perfect for 12 months - now forever frozen!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2021,"I really loved my kindle! Key word, ‘loved’ as in past tense. I bought it 13 months ago and out of the blue it has stopped working! Literally a week after the warranty expired the screen froze and has not unfrozen since. I have tried everything! I’m not sure what is wrong with it but I was so surprised when I googled the problem and hundreds of people experienced the same thing! Most of these consumers had to go and buy new kindles, which I am just not willing to do. £120 for something that is only going to last a year is absurd. Im really disappointed as I loved my kindle, used it often, always treated it right, never dropped it, etc. I have received no help from Amazon concerning advice to fix it, and at this point do not plan on buying a new one. It’s really upsetting and I really think everyone should be aware of this “faulty feature” of the kindles. Not sure what is causing it, but amazon should be taking initiative to fix it, and aren’t."
Chas-Street,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed with the Battery Life,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2019,"I've been using an iPad for 5 years to read my kindle books. My iPad generally runs for around 10 hours on a full charge, so I thought I'd treat myself to a Kindle -  I'm an avid reader and thought the battery would last significantly longer. Unfortunately the battery life is nothing like as good as advertised. I get around 48 hours reading from a full charge. So while the battery does last longer than my iPad, if you read a lot it won't last the equivalent of a week from a full charge. Also I turned it off completely for a few days and the charge still dropped from 94% to 86% without even being used. My advice - if you're going on holiday for more than 2 or 3 days always make sure you have  your charger & lead with you. Finally having read other reviews I do switch it to ""Airplane mode"" to conserve power while I'm reading, also I keep the backlight off when reading in daylight. So I'm rather disappointed with it's performance.The good points: it was quick and easy to download my book collection, the text is easy to read, and of course it's much smaller and lighter than my iPad to tote around."
Jules C. May,5.0 out of 5 stars,Up-to-date version of this classic product.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 January 2020,"I asked Santa for one of these after my cleaner trod on my old 3rd gen (keyboard-style) kindle and broke the screen.Initial impressions are very good.  It feels much smaller to hold (even though the screen is exactly the same size), and the image is much clearer.  I like having just a touch of backlight - it helps the page look whiter - but in the evenings, it's great.  Screen refresh is quick, and battery life is impressive.Only gripe I've got is: this model understands collections differently to the way the apps and other Kindle devices do.  I was very confused to begin with (as I know other people have been). Now I understand what's happening, but I still find it more clumsy than the old way.  I don't understand why the software developers would have changed this, and I wish they'd change it back.Other than that: very happy indeed."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing quality not as good as older versions,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 November 2019,I replaced my 6th generation kindle (2014) with latest paperwhite after dropping in the bath for second time and was glad to replace with a waterproof version  with larger storage. I bought from John Lewis as I had vouchers to use. The back light is poor and I have to increase to near maximum to improve clarity for reading.  The battery is no better than my older kindle and lasts a few days only. It's slow to download books and I have to keep repeating the process and it can have problems syncing.  I've tried to get use to it's failings but I'm not sure if I have a dud one? I plan to contact John Lewis to see if I can get a replacement as I've not had it 12 months yet.
Bedesman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Registration Fraud.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 September 2020,"My attempt to register my new Kindle was blocked my a person unknown who claimed there was  a problem with  IP Address Encryption which could not be corrected by Amazon. To prove his identity as an Amazon employee he said this was my third Kindle, that I had a library of 40 books and displayed the first page of my Kindle library on my screen. I was telephoned my BestAdvisors who required payment to correct the IP problem on behalf of Amazon. I foolishly agreed to pay. I later received a second telephone call  to say the problem had been corrected and my Kindle was now fully functional.  This proved to be correct. I now feel certain this was a fraudulent activity carried out against both myself and Amazon. BEWARE."
K. Woodhead,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 January 2019,"It has been a few weeks since I purchased the Kindle.  It is quite responsive to touch, maybe a bit too much.  I find that when you are holding it, it turns the page as you are a bit close to the screen.  It is a bit too sensitive to touch and I am forever having to go back.  I much prefer the older version, where there was a distinction between the screen and the frame.  I wouldn’t upgrade unless like me you dropped your previous kindle in the bath.Update - Just over a month old an issue occurred with the power, reset the kindle and it lasted just over a month again - now being replaced."
AniaKass,4.0 out of 5 stars,Wonderful device,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2019,"I love my new Paperwhite Kindle. I love that I can pack around SO MANY books! I will say, I have never been a fan of touch screens though (I actually love my old Kindle better b/c it's NOT touch screen, and I feel it is easier to navigate, but that may be b/c I'm used to it). I do wish there was an easier way to freeze and unfreeze the screen on the new paperwhite. But I do really like that I can change the brightness of the built-in-light, font, font size, layout, and see page number or % read. I recommend to anyone who is thinking about getting one of these devices to do so, especially if you're the kind of person to pack books around. It is amazing and wonderful how many books you can have, including getting ebooks from the library and whatnot."
Don. G.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Device from Hell,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2019,I bought one of these today. SPENT OVER 2 HOURS TRYING TO GET IT TO CONNECT MY WI-FI AND A FURTHER 1HOUR AND 4 MINS WITH MY INTERNET PROVIDER BEFORE IT WOULD CONNECT! This necessitated changing the existing wifi network settings and wifi password!! WHY???? Never had any problems connecting devices to my wifi before! Then I tried to connect to my very long-standing Amazon account. Again problems. Password-verified as correct-constantly rejected necessitating a complete password reset! The keyboards to enter data in were also awful. That is far as I have got. I will return it tomorrow as I am far from satisfied and do not fancy any more problems in trying to download a book to it!
Michael Evans,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, until it stops working.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2020,"Originally the Kindle was great, it had ample storage and combined with the fact books dont take up a huge amount of room anyway, it looked like it was going to be a way for me to get back into reading. It was easy to use and bright enough.Unfortunately this was short lived as after having charged it fully twice, when the battery died, it would no longer turn on or function at all. Instead was a screen that said ""Battery condition critical"" with a large battery symbol and an exclamation mark in the centre.Of course the first thing anyone would do would be to consult Google and search for any ways to get it working again (resets and etc), but unfortunately all that came up was that it is apparently a common fault that if you do not charge a Kindle in its ""low battery"" state then you run the risk of having the battery go flat, and unlike other devices where you can just charge it up again, there's a large chance that the Kindle wont charge at all and be stuck in this state. Leaving it completely useless.I have used the Kindle approximately 10-15 times since I bought it, had it in a hard case, and it hadn't been in any way conditions etc, therefore in no way should it be failing that miserably already.So, dont let the battery drain completely!Edit:After contacting Amazon to solve the issue, I was offered to purchase a new device due to being a few days out of my warranty. The operator was polite and tried his best to help me get the device working, but to no avail.I am gutted that there's no option for repair or replacenent, as I was really looking forward to using it on my honeymoon in 6 weeks time. To provide a £120 device with a battery that cant hold reserve charge is beyond stupid, even £10 phones from Tesco have this function.Dissapointed in Amazon."
Kathryn Nicholl,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the best reader yet!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 May 2019,"I already had a Paperwhite but I had stupidly let something fall on it and it had created a small ""hole"" which let light through so asked my family for this one for Christmas. Transferring the e-books from the old one was a piece of cake and loading on my audiobooks from Audible was equally easy. Headphones connect via Bluetooth, so a whole entertainment experience in one small, very easily readable - even in the brightest sunlight - and adjustable package. It is also incredibly light and fits easily into a patch pocket or small shoulder bag. Oh, and right now it has 998 e-books and 31 audiobooks on it plus some PDFs, and I still have nearly 22 gb free! Battery life is brilliant too and you get plenty of warning when a re-charge is needed. Wouldn't be without it!"
S. J. Pritchard,1.0 out of 5 stars,Battery design fault.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 March 2021,"The ereader itself is a very good product as attested to by the multiple 5 star reviews. However, should it develop a fault out of warranty then don't expect any offer of repair. There is no such thing. Just an offer to buy a discounted replacement. Not exactly environmentally friendly. After two years of moderate use mine was left uncharged whilst I read a paper book. After finishing the book I picked up the Kindle to start an ebook only to see the dreaded empty battery/exclamation mark symbol. Worse still, when plugged in to charge, no orange/green light. Taking to the internet to find a solution, none were apparent. All tutorials and Amazon's own help guide all needed at least the light to show. The online support chat finally ended with sorry but out of warranty, can't send a new one. Here's 15% discount to buy a new one. No offer of paid for repair just throw away and buy a new one. I don't want to spend £120 every two years on an ereader. So a bit more research and a YouTube video later, the back was off. It's interesting to see all connectors glued down. Makes it difficult to repair. Even the battery is glued in. Not to be deterred, the battery connector was lifted from the glue and then reconnected and voila! The light came on. 20 minutes work and £120 saved. The battery/exclamation mark seems to be a common one if left to completely drain of charge so lesson learned. Keep it charged. But this seems to be a bit of a design fault. So, before forking out for a new one and it's out of warranty, be brave and take the back off. If you're not willing to do it, try a mobile repair shop first. Not sure how waterproof it will be after the back has been off so I wouldn't take it in the bath!!"
Cadajota,5.0 out of 5 stars,Much easier than using a heavy tablet,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2020,I originally owned the old version of a kindle for many years - eventually upgrading to a tablet and giving my original kindle to my bookworm of a daughter. I soon regretted getting rid as although my tablet is all singing and dancing it is nowhere near as portable as a kindle - and no where near as lightweight. The back light on this Kindle paper white and the ease of use makes this as portable as a phone but easier to read. I strongly recommend getting a case for it as protection. It makes reading in bed better too - don't have to have a light on keeping hubby awake. Works a treat. Thoroughly recommend this little gem.
KPF,1.0 out of 5 stars,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 January 2021,Worst product I have ever bought.... DO NOT BUY THIS!!! If you still feel tempted at least keep it charged.... the batteries are notoriously terrible. Had mine 1 year and a month and read 2 books on it... left in a draw for 6 months... it was immaculate... took it out to a critical battery error and it never worked again. Now have a refurbished one as a replacement... it works when it feels like it! Terrible bit of kit... massively disappointed my previous kindle lasted me 10+ years and was awesome. Will never buy another kindle.
FODI Attila,4.0 out of 5 stars,A new era of reading begun for me,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 November 2020,"This is my first e-book reader ever, so I had to get used to it, which means I have nothing to compare it with.The reason I bought it was simply to reduce the weight of my rucksack when I go trekking.First of all, it is lightweight and easy to hold (with the case I bought it). I am a bibliophile, so I still miss the smell of the ink, but it seems to be a good and lightweight book-alternative during the evenings in a tent or on my way from A to B, on a bus, train or airplane.All the books I downloaded are working fine, I even sent a pdf version of my own work to it to check how it can be read on the screen and I am satisfied with the result.There is only one thing which could make it even better, the colours (I like the illustrated editions of books, but everything is B&W)."
Andrew Warn,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great but a little pricey,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 March 2019,"Well made and easy to use. I can’t give it 5 star for two reasons. One is that it is very unresponsive when using it to browse for new books and such. You tap something like search and it takes a few seconds to be ready to type. When you start to type it can’t keep up and you have to wait for what you have typed to appear. The second thing is the price. I paid £119 for this and in my opinion it is more like an £80 product. At £119 it should be much more responsive. The pro’s are that is is well made, slim, easy to use and as reasonable battery life. Though I should mention that the battery is not as good has they say it is. If you read for 30 mins or less a day then I expect the battery life will last the weeks they mention but I went through 50% battery in about 5 days. I was reading for about 60 mins per day"
KP,4.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Light and Bright,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 March 2020,I am pleased with my new kindle. The back light is really good as I am able to read last thing at night or first thing in the morning without disturbing anyone by having to put on a light.The battery lasts at least 2 weeks before it needs recharging. It might be even longer.However I don't find the touchscreen as easy as my previous kindle to navigate books and find pages. Also I didn't realise that I would not be able to use audiobooks so for the price I paid that was disappointing.I do like the kindle but I do think it is overpriced for the media provided.
Gwill,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not a happy bunny,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 August 2019,"Very disappointed. Firstly, battery lasts for weeks my backside. I fully charged it and after less than an hour reading with the kindle light on half way the battery was on 89%. Secondly, my old kindle would have a slight glow to the screen even before turning the light on. Decided the other night to have a read but couldn’t see a thing from the new kindle. Had to turn on lamp so I could read the screen and find the light setting. Lastly, I wish this option of with/without special offers was more understandable. I now know that if I turn them off I will be billed £10. Never saw that on the Amazon listing. ☹️☹️Update 21st October 2020The screen now greys out at random times and when I’m in the kindle store I’m unable to swipe up.Very, very unhappy. ☹️☹️"
Pauline Lee,4.0 out of 5 stars,A great kindle with built in light,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2020,"Having one of the original kindles which is over 10 years old, I felt it was time for an updated model.  The paperwhite is much lighter in weight, smaller, easier to read - especially in the dark and I like it.  What  disappointed me - although my long list of books purchased over the years have been dowloaded and, my folders are visible, when I have finished a book & moved it to a folded, on rhe paper white, it does not remove the read books in folders from my current list of books to read & I find this very frustrating.  If anyone has any ideas on how to move them without deleting them, I would love to hear how to do this."
Alexa Clark,5.0 out of 5 stars,Massive book lover - CONVERTED TO KINDLE!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 May 2020,"*Detailed review ahead BUT I hope this helps*:I’ve always been one of those people who would never order a Kindle because they prefer an actual book. However, thought I’d treat myself to one for lockdown and try it out, if only to save a hell of a lot of money on books with all the extra reading I’ve been doing with this spare time!And... I LOVE IT. It doesn’t really feel like you are reading off a device as the screen is not like a smartphone glare. I also like it as I can read outside and the screen is still perfect in the sun just like paper, also don’t have the annoyance of wind blowing pages all over. It’s waterproof so you can also read in the bath without worry! The built in LED means you can read on a night before bed without getting eye strain which is perfect for me as I have always enjoyed reading a quick chapter or two to wind down before bed.The discounts available on the kindle store make this well worth the money and switch to a kindle if you are tempted but not sure if you’ll like it compared to an actual book. I’ve found I haven’t really noticed a difference, if anything I’m reading the books even quicker. I have saved as much as around 85% off the price of some books I have wanted for a long time by getting them on the kindle store. For example, as I’m a massive fan of The Last Kingdom on Netflix, I got the first 6 books in the series on the kindle store for about £6.99, as opposed to the usual retail price for the physical set of books being anything around £50-£60!!Finally, another side of the Paperwhite I like is that you can highlight and comment on quotes, you can also hold on a word and it will bring up either translations (if another language) or general info from the internet (e.g. a historical figure). I have found this particularly useful as I am going into Secondary Teaching so have highlighted a few passages which are now saved on the kindle, which I can use as thinking points/part of activities in lessons.I was torn between this and the earlier model. The earlier is cheaper, but I have found the Paperwhite is still great value for money and I believe you are getting more features to make it a better reading experience (e.g. LED, flush screen, waterproof). And I just wanted to have a newer model, I always prefer this when ordering new devices so it’s more up-to-date for any future updates.So, overall (apologies this has been very long but I have written it with people like myself in mind, who may have toyed with the idea of a kindle for years but not sure if they will like it compared to a usual book):*great value for money*haven’t missed reading a physical book. If anything I’m now reading books faster*unbelievable discounts available on kindle store - you are saving a HELL of a lot of money compared to physical books*great features - LED and waterproof*other perks e.g. highlighting and saving passages/quotes to your device"
Vee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fabulous and better than the normal kindle by far,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 September 2020,"So much better and worth the extra money over the normal kindle.I was sceptical about the light setting but it is really good. The dark mode is also better for my eyes.  The best thing about this however, is that I can lock the font settings which have driven me crazy for 6 years with my other 2 normal kindles I have had.  Hooray!!The bonus is that it is water resistant and  as I am very clumsy it is a good idea.Extremely happy and reading again for hours with no issues.Battery power is no problem as long as wifi is off and I'm not using audible,  which I dont."
tfoxon,2.0 out of 5 stars,Beware of buying a Kindle with Special Offers.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2019,I have had a kindle and loved it for many years and have bought and read a number of books over the years. It is probably the technology that i have used the most. The most annoying thing for me and that is why I have only given it 3 stars is the the special offers adverts on it. I didn’t know what that meant when I bought it. I thought buying meant I would receive something in the box with special offers but no it is adverts on the home screen and on the screensaver which for me ruins the whole design and feel of the product. If it wasn’t for the adverts I would have given the kindle 5 stars as i do love it. Please be warned if you buy a kindle with special offers it does mean you will get adverts. I would rather have paid the extra if i had know.
Kevin Mansell,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best ereader I have tried so far,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2019,"Light & easy to read with lots of storage space.  The Kindle Paperwhite is simply very easy to get along with as the menu system makes it a doddle to change settings such as font size, spacing, etc.My only real criticism so far is that the reading screen itself could be bigger if the edges around the screen were not so large.  Other than this the only niggle is through my own clumsiness as several times I have opened up the menu's unintentionally when trying to turn the page, though I'm sure that once I am better familiarised/practiced with it this will no longer be a problem.  Overall I find it better than my previous Kobo e-reader (though that is now several years old)."
RJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic e-reader,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 August 2020,"I love the kindle paperwhite. I have had one for the last four years, but unfortunately lost my last one. I use it daily so bought this as a replacement very quickly.It is easy to fit in a pocket or handbag. It is very lightweight, easy to hold. I love the flexibility of the e-reader to change the font size. When I'm tired, it's easy to make the font slightly larger. I have come to prefer the kindle to physical books. I love to read different books depending on my mood, so having that flexibility is brilliant for me. The great advantage if this version of the paperwhite is that it's waterproof. A definite bonus for when at the beach, pool or simply relaxing in the bath."
gg,5.0 out of 5 stars,converted!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 August 2019,"Firstly I have to say we are massive book fans and could not really decide to make the transition to Kindle for travelling for ages - the physical feel of a book is just different. However I have to say we now love the Kindle (I bought 2 outright and am glad I did or else my husband might have stolen mine off me. :)The menu takes some getting used to - it's not as intuitive/user friendly as many other electronic products I use, so reading the user guide makes sense, but once you work it out it is brilliant and both my husband and I used it very successfully on our holiday this year. It is brilliant for travel & for reading in bed when your partner wants to sleep already.We LOVE our new Kindles and would definitely recommend it."
Welsh Cath,5.0 out of 5 stars,A superb Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2020,"After two weeks of daily use, I’m very happy with my purchase. It’s lightweight and easy to use. The battery life is superb and the touch screen is good, although a little slow at times. I’ve used the kindle commuting, to read in bed and in the bath. The fact that it has tolerance to water makes me a bit more comfortable about bath time reading!The built in light is effective without being intrusive; I can read in bed at night without waking up my husband.It’s easy to access your library of books and quick to download.Overall an excellent Kindle and I thoroughly recommended."
Sean Barker,4.0 out of 5 stars,Faulty but replaced,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 June 2020,"Pretty much useless.I had the previous paperwhite which was excellent but this models battery life is so poor that unless its fully charged every couple of days its dead.I have it on airplane mode, wifi off, bluetooth off and there is no indexing going on. I also have the back-light completely off.Very very dissapointed*****UPDATE*****I have since returned this and had it replaced with a new one.The replacement works perfectly and has the sort of battery life you would expect.My original was clearly faulty.If you do end uo with one that has a battery that only lasts a couple of days return it.It could be thst mine eas a one off or maybe there is a bad batch out there.I have now adjusted the star rating from one to four"
Maggie,1.0 out of 5 stars,Received incorrect order- Misleading and very disappointed customer.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2020,"I ordered x2 Kindles on Amazon Prime day, one was a Sage colour and the other Twilight Blue. Amazon were offering a cover and charger as part of a bundle deal. I decided to purchase the bundle deal for both of the Kindles. I noticed that the colour of the Kindle had reverted to black so I cancelled the order and got in touch with customer service. I was assured that I would in fact receive the colour I ordered and not to worry. I have since received both Kindles and they were in fact not the colours I ordered but the black coloured Kindle.I have been in touch with Customer service numerous times about this issue and I thought I had resolved it yesterday but the Amazon Representative made a replacement with the exact same black coloured kindle instead of the Sage and Twilight Blue one. I am after spending over 3hrs back and forth over chat to finally be told that as part of the offer you do not have the option of choosing a coloured kindle and that you can only have the black one. If I was aware of this on the day of purchase I would have not purchased the bundle deal.Very disappointed with the lack of customer service and confusion regarding this. It seemed very straight forward to me that you could just replace the Kindle with a different colour. I am a Prime Member customer also and was waiting almost a month to receive one of the kindles. Extremely disappointed with the entire service."

J. Malcolm,4.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 June 2020,"I had initially left a lower rated review due to what appeared to be a battery failure one day after my Replacement Window closed. I am retracting that and giving it a four star rating insteadThe device has been great for the year that I've used it apart from the recent battery scare. The device gave me a low battery warning while using it in bed. No problem. I plugged it into a USB cable going into a wall adaptor. What I didn't realise is that either the cable or the wall charger had failed. Next day the battery was completely flat. Battery icon with exclamation point. I tried ever combination of USB cable and charger I could find to no avail. What you have to do is hold in the power button for something like 40 seconds. Then plug it into a USB charger that can supply decent power. Not just your laptop or whatever. Either a decent working wall charger or a powered USB hub and leave it until fully charged.One niggle I did find when using it was it was sometimes possible to accidentally turn the screen off while reading, just from changing grip on it."
ceejaysteady,3.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of money changing from 2014 model,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 November 2018,"This is the 3rd Kindle I have had and I realised immediately that I had probably wasted my money in buying it. Right at the start having transferred my current library onto it I found that I was unable to turn the pages to see the book list content in my  library without inadvertently opening a title. The menu navigation was a bit difficult on my last model but this takes it to a new height. I also see that I get a note of the page I am at in a book but no longer get the ""Page... of ...."" display. Added to that my mistake of getting the sharp cornered and uncomfortable fabric cover and I am at the stage of returning both.I will give it a couple of days and then decide"
Emma G,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my Kindle Paperwhite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2020,"Can hold all my books, the audiobook with bluetooth headphones in the car, a pleasure to read on and the light doesn't glare. Bed reading doesn't disturb my partner.Always have a next book to hand, charge lasts weeks, one handed reading (read and eat = no reading time lost at work lunchtime) and takes up the space of a very thin novella.I love my Kindle and go everywhere with it. I read so much more with the Kindle and find it easier than holding paper books especially since a vast majority of the books I read are 400+ pages."
MaoMao13,1.0 out of 5 stars,The never-ending font size pop up box that obscures your reading,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 March 2019,"I bought this model for my 50th birthday, after my old Kindle Voyage finally died. Very soon after buying this Kindle, it became impossible to read due to the font adjustment box appearing at the top of the page and refusing to disappear. This happened at the beginning of EVERY chapter in EVERY book. A forty minute call to Amazon resulted only in a factory reset, which only temporarily sorted the issue. The same problem is now back, Amazon haven't sorted it, and I feel ripped off. I've used Kindle e-readers for years and have been very loyal to the brand, but this one is impossible!I really miss my old Kindle Voyage. This device is not a patch on it"
Brummie Sue,1.0 out of 5 stars,Really bad experience,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 July 2019,"This must be the 4th Kindle I've had and ordered it because it was advertised as having a long battery life and my current kindle is needing charging more and more frequently.  First one arrived and it wouldn't synchronise with my library on Amazon.  Spent ages on chat and speaking to the helpline, restarting it resetting it and getting nowhere.  They decided I needed a replacement so send me another kindle.  Same problem again.  I decided to manually download just the books I hadn't read but then noticed the battery was running down really quickly.  I spent more time speaking to the helpline being asked to reset, restart it and eventually decided I didn't want to spend anymore time trying to get it fixed so returned the lot (kindle, cover and charger) for a refund.  I'm back to using my old kindle.  I've only given it 1 star because I couldn't give it a zero.  Hopefully the new model when its released will be much better!"
Rar89,5.0 out of 5 stars,A brilliant solution for my overflowing book collection,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2020,"I bought this with my Christmas money so I suppose you can say that it was a present. I got a Kindle when they first came out eons ago which I loved and when I lost that I got a Kindle Fire which I wasn't too fond of.I absolutely love the Kindle Paperwhite. I've had it about two weeks and I've already got through three books. I love knowing that I've got a tonne of books with me on the go and I never have to worry about battery life. Also, it is very quick and easy to buy more books. This is ideal for those who love to take a book with them wherever they go and for those whose book shelves are slightly overfilled."
minajarrow,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not impressed as has many bad points compared to my kindle voyage.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2021,I bought this to replace a kindle voyage and wish I had not bothered. It has glitches. It takes a longer time to wake up than my old one. It freezes frequently and is not responsive when trying to reboot. Trying to touch the screen to go back a page is very hit and miss and sometimes the screen scrambles. The voyage was a far better device.
Amanda Kemp,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 August 2020,"I had a first generation kindle and loved it at first but then just liked the feel of a book and knowing how much longer you had in a chapter before you turned the light off at 2am!  Now I have arthritis in my hands and holding a book is now painful after reading for a while.  So I decided to get a new kindle.  I love it! Can’t stop reading it, the best thing is the light.  You can read in bed without struggling to see and read in the garden with no reflections.  It’s light to hold and can even read with one hand and a dog on your lap."
SP,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Product at the Right Price,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 July 2019,"This isn't my first Kindle reader.  I have been impressed in the past and this current model is no exception.  For those opting for the cheaper model I would say that it will deliver, but you will miss the built-in light which allows reading at night or in reduced light situations.  For those who fear keeping sleeping partners awake by reading late at night the Paperwhite should allay their fears.  The 8GB version is fine for me as I tend to remove books from the reader when I have finished them.  For those who like to keep their whole collection downloaded they may want a bigger capacity.  I find my readers excellent for holidays.  They are light, compact and easily stored.  I would recommend."
Oleg Afanasyev,3.0 out of 5 stars,Usability is inferior compared to non touch devices,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 August 2020,"Kindle is barely usable for anything other than linear fiction reads while holding it in right hand.UI is very slow making touch interface a PITA to use.- selecting more than a single word is annoying, you have to do it slowly as display update lags seconds- navigating few pages back or forth is bad as it remembers number of strokes/touches made and keeps scrolling at 1 page/sec pace. you have to painfully wait for page to flip before doing next gesture so not to overshoot- you can't wipe a dust or a hair from the screen because it would flip the page :D- you can't maintain a solid grip and flip pages with the same hand unless you have a large hand, so forget about reading it in transport while holding handrailsAll those problems didn't exist in button operated readers.The only advantage this kindle has is backlight which is the reason i have to use it to read at night."
JCG,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not My Favourite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 September 2019,"As I read in the bath and my last Kindle ended up in the sea when I fell down some harbour steps, I decided on the waterproof version.  This is my 4th Kindle and the most disappointing one to date.  It's very slow to react when turned on and I really do not like the fact that there is no raised frame to protect the screen.  This means that I often go backwards by mistake whilst reading and have to be very careful to hold it on its edges.I love Kindles and would never be without one, and I am sure that the ""no edges"" design is part of the waterproofing, but this is not my favourite."
Mr Pete Panesar,4.0 out of 5 stars,Migrated from Kobo but have only one issue,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 November 2018,"After having used Kobo devices for the last few years, I finally moved across to the new 2018 waterproof Kindle.. Absolutely brilliant.. However there is one thing which keeps catching me out.. each time I stand the device upright and place it on a desk to read, it power off!  This is due to the main power button being located at the bottom... this could work it it was a sliding switch as per the Kobe or it they reposition the on/off button to the side or top of the Kindle..Only a minor note, other than that it is worth the dollar and the backlight is great.I would like to think that there may be some feedback from amazon on perhaps a rethink on the power button?"
Anna W,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dont buy!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2021,"I wish I hadn't bought it - have spent two days struggling with this and now it seems to have turned itself permanently.  My old Kindle is a very basic one (probably 8 years old) but so much better;  the only problem with it was that the battery wasn't holding a charge for very long.  It's impossible to navigate this new version, impossible to delete unwanted books which transferred (I had to log into my  Amazon account to do this).  Frustrating and unresponsive,  not user-friendly.  The supposed leather cover feels like cheap plastic.  How do I return the Kindle and cover now I have downloaded all my books?"
brummielass,5.0 out of 5 stars,Finally changed from old Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 June 2019,"Finally decided to change from my original Kindle of 2012 to the new Kindle Paper White. Whilst it is lovely to read it is heavier to hold than my previous Kindle now that I have put the plastic cover on!The transfer of my vast library of books did happen but unfortunately as many of the books were held in different folders and they transferred into my library on mass into one very large group of books,  I am having trouble finding an individual book at the moment. I had hoped that the books would be transferred into the folders that I created on my old kindle but this was not to be.The new paperwhite lay out is taking some getting used to but with perseverance I am sure I will eventually get things sorted."
Steven Underdown,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2018,"Disappointed. I was looking forward to getting this. I pushed the boat out and ordered one with large memory and no advertising ‘extras’. ... I’ve had it a few weeks. ... It’s ok, but nothing more. I'd been drawn in when I heard that it would work, not just with Kindle books, but with Audible files too. It does play audio, but only via Bluetooth headphones or a Bluetooth speaker, not with plug-in devices. And very disappointinglpy (for me) it doesn’t allow for ‘immersive’ reading, ie, for following the text on-screen while listening to the audio. Apparently the processor is not up to doing this.Yes, It’s light-weight and tiny. But all in all, I’d have been better getting a kindle tablet and using that for dedicated reading (and which would have allowed immersive reading too).  As it is, I find myself ignoring the paperwhite and using my iPad for books and Audible - just as I had been doing. By the way, the cover is very expensive for what it is. It’s a Poundland item at a premium price."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love being able to listen on my bluetooth speaker,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2020,"In general an improvement on my old Paperwhite Kindle, especially the fact that it can be linked to a bluetooth speaker to allow the book to be listened to instead of read.  The waterproof is good too, although I have been reading my kindle in the bath for the last 10 years and have only dropped it in once.My knocking off of one star is because the on/off button is proud of the kindle which means it keeps switching on and off accidently, especially if being used resting on a shelf.  I have solved the inconvenience by buying a back-only case; I just wish that hadn't been necessary."
TeriK,4.0 out of 5 stars,The adjustable light is good for night reading,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 August 2020,"The light is a really good feature for me. The unit is smaller than my old kindle, the screen is the same size, it just doesn't have the buttons as it's touch screen. I do not find it is any easier than my old one as you need to hit the screen to turn the page as well as balance the unit. Also there seems to be no definite spot to hit to turn forward or back and I often go the wrong way. Having said that it has some nice easy features on the pull down menu, I just wish it were a bit easier to operate one handed as advertised."
A Wilkins,4.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t get the one with Adverts!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 April 2020,"I bought this to update my old kindle which I loved. I didn’t realise the full impact of the adverts.They made it slow to start, drained the battery much more quickly and took longer to charge.I don’t really feel inclined to pay extra in order to not be inundated with adverts, but it was only £10, so I paid up.Amazon responded to my review and suggested turning off the wi-fi, which I do by turning on airplane mode, not sure if there is another way..These things seem so obvious when you get told them.Anyway, I feel a bit of an idiot, and Im much happier with it now, so thanks Amazon :)"
andy60chemist,5.0 out of 5 stars,Similar to earlier versions,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 December 2020,"If, like me, you are replacing a kindle that has stopped working, it is reassuringly familiar. setting up hit only one glitch - when I indicated I didn't want it to provide an app for my mobile. The screen froze and I had no option other than restart. Once inside it linked quickly and restored my library and all the settings and movements aer the same as my previous touch screen kindle. Hope it lasts longer.the delivery date on the order was surprisingly long (almost a month, but it has arrived 7-10 days early. good psychology??"
William G,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good product but annoying marketing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 March 2020,The new kindle white replaces a kindle paper white that I  bought in 2013 and had no problems until the other day the motherboard faulted for no reason whatsoever and means that I have had to dispose off an immaculately kept kindle through no fault of my own.Although I have now replaced the dead kindle ( amazon did give me a 15% reduction off list price) with the latest model which as a previous a reviewer had posted said ignore all sales Schmuk on start up which I did and the reader is still displaying adverts on start up which is highly annoying and very frustrating to view each time I open the reader.Amazon you need to learn customer choice. This type of marketing only makes me want to shop elsewhere in future PLEASE REMOVE THIS UNCALLED FOR  ADVERTISING POSTE HASTEA disgruntled reviewer but more than happy kindle user
Josh,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Has it's issues, but would still recommend.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 January 2020,"Was bought due to swiftly running out of room for physical books. Although, I have to admit, I was very against kindles in the beginning as I preferred owning the physical copy. But I have to admit that it is a useful little gadget, not only is it easy to travel with - due to it being slim and compact - but it also has a handy for work, as I read a lot if PDFs I was able to email them to myself and read whenever travelling.The screen adjusts to your environment, which I find to be a handy feature as you can remain invested in a book even when lighting changes in the room or vehicle you may be travelling in.The battery life is quite standard, it lasts for as long as you could need. But as with anything, the more it is used, the more it needs to be charged.The downside of the kindle is that it appears to be fairly glitchy and there is a slight delay in response time with the touchscreen. Although this isn't something that has effected it greatly, as it still does its job - and does so very well I might add.All-in-all, it is a handy gadget. One that I'd recommend to those who are running out of space on their bookshelves - and like me don't like to give away their books. It has its issues, but I believe you'd struggle finding anything that doesn't."
weasley figbat,4.0 out of 5 stars,Mostly great... mostly.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 June 2019,"Overall, there’s a lot to like. I bought this to replace my venerable 4th gen Kindle (which still works perfectly but was gifted to my daughter).  The backlight is great as I can now read at night without having a lamp on so not disturbing anybody else.  The touchscreen works fine but is less engaging than page turn buttons, and means you can’t read it one-handed as well (example, holding it in your left hand means you can’t turn the page without using your other hand).Battery life is proving to be great, even using the light at a low level. It is easy to use standalone in terms of finding and downloading books. It is also reassuringly solid to hold, with a surprising but welcome weight to it."
Vik,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2018,"After the very sad demise of my 1st gen Kindle keyboard, night reading is now a breeze. No more fumbling for a torch or crimes against my husband when turning my bedside lamp on! So while it does mean I'm happier to greet my insomnia so I can pick up my kindle it does mean I'm more tired during the day!I am also making great use of its waterproof feature by reading in the bath. It feels very indulgent.So what is all this reading foing to the battery? After 2 weeks of ownership and s couple of hours reading a day the battery is currently at 43%.Are there any downsides? Well I loved the home screen interface of my beloved kindle keyboard and don't much like the confused mess of this one. I tend to look for and buy books on my phone and download then!Finally a positive for Amazon ive now subscribed to unlimited and I'm looking forward to trying out its audible features as soon as I find my headphones..."
Bonnie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reassuringly simple,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2019,"This is my third kindle paperwhite  - doesn’t seem very different at all. Thought it might be a bit faster being an upgrade but don’t see much difference. it does the job and I only got a new one because I needed more storage. Battery life seems okay so far, but I only read about an hour at night using low light. Pleased to get the option of black screen with white text. Seamless and very quick sync of books and docs from my account. Very easy setup. Thinner than my last kindle. Bought an Amazon cloth-style case - looks great and very sleek. Will fit easier into my pocket. It’s a kindle - it’s not offering a new experience just reassuringly the same."
Tom,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good product, but annoying that they discount it just after I bought it!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 February 2021,"Annoyed that just a couple of weeks after I bought it they decided to knock £20 off the price. Also annoyed that despite paying £120 for something, Amazon still think it's acceptable to plaster adverts all of it.The product is good, but not great. It's light and easy to hold and has nice features like a built in dictionary. It is quite slow and unresponsive but seeing as you are mainly just using it to read, that isnt the end of the world.The waterproof model makes out that you can just read care free in the bath and that if you were drop it in then you could just get it out and carry on reading but according to the manual, that is not the case. You would need to turn it off and allow it to dry fully.Overall it does what it says. I would probably not bother getting the more expensive waterproof version. The fact you can choose a colour is quite nice though."
Gary G,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Nice device, so far, so good.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2020,"Got this for my birthday, together with the Amazon-branded case, which didn't fit the device (although both boxes clearly stated 10th generation, very frustrating).. The case had to be returned and instead, I got a different brand (Foxwood) for a fiver less. So, apart from the case size issue, all good regarding the device itself. very small and easy to handle, with an excellent battery life which I was grateful for on a transatlantic trip last week.Not tried all of the features yet (e.g. audiobooks and BlueTooth connections), but so far the device does everything I need it to."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Some disappoinbtment,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 September 2020,Not impressed with the battery life my old one the battery lasted  longer just on reading stupid adds waste battery and unnecessary. The adverts for book irrelevant as far as i am concerned. Something I do not require or want. Books  I wish to read I look up. Why put it on them charge if customer wants it removed. A money spinner for Amazon either way they cannot lose out Bluetooth ideal for audio books. Apart from that not much better than my old model which i only changed as it developed a fault not worth the extra money
sarah aldred,1.0 out of 5 stars,this kindle has lasted me from May to January and has now died completely,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 February 2020,"this is my 4th kindle and I was originally very pleased with my new kindle, bought it in November and put it away for a few months waiting for my old one to die first so started using from MAY 2019, Last weekend decided to finally add more books onto it to take it to half way on the memory, since then it has become completely unusable, holds no charge at all constantly restarting after trying to read 1 page, and then it puts you back to the main front page and doesn't remember where you got to in the book.i have factory reset 4 times and its getting worse trying to do anything with it at all, laptop won't recognise it, when you do connect when disconnecting just gives errors and reboots and reboots continually until the battery dies, within 1 hr today went from fully charged to flat and I wasn't even using it, considering it costs £150 I'm gutted to say the least that I'll have to replace this yet again."
anne Bull,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Value xx,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2018,It’s my 3rd kindle. My most favourite was my 1st. It was the one with key pad at bottom and page turners.  Whilst I do love my new one it’s the new water proof version I purchased it on Black Friday so good deal. The one I really really wanted is the oasis as it has page turning buttons I like them currently I don’t have this kindle in a case so very often turn pages when not wanting too. Especially when I’m falling asleep.  It’s much quicker than my previous kindle not sure if that’s the kindle or my last one was getting sluggish as it was getting on. Apart from that I’m not sure there is any difference. Would have been nice to get the oasis but could not justify the hick in money.  Pity  I would recommend this kindle to anyone looking or thinking about getting one as price is good.  Guess it would be perfect if it had buttons to turn page 😘
Marie,3.0 out of 5 stars,A little disappointed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2020,"I have been using kindle on my phone and expected it to work much the same.  Its software and library functions aren't the same and isn't as nice to use.  I really wish it worked more like my phone.  When reading the book it works well and is light enough.  Another thing is that the sales blurb says it is audible compatible and that was of interest to me.  I knew I couldn't connect it to my Sonos but I suppose I will have to buy a Amazon speaker, despite the fact I don't want most of its functions.  Either that or buy some bluetooth headphones but I haven't got that far yet."
spindles,5.0 out of 5 stars,A very happy reader.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 August 2020,"I was used to reading books on my kindle fire which was okay until I went in the sun.  During covid-19 I have increased my reading time and as have had lots of sunshine have been in the garden, well trying.  The kindle fire isn't up to the job in the sun.  So I decided to treat myself to a kindle paperwhite and with an offer on a purchase was made.  I am so pleased with my paperwhite, it was easy to set up, light to hold even with a case.  Fantastic in the sun, can even read in the sun with sunglasses on. Best decision  I made"
Paula,5.0 out of 5 stars,holds the charge for ages and easy to use,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 February 2020,"Even though the info says holds a charge for weeks,mine doesn't but only because I am constantly downloading books from kindle and unlimited,but it still lasts just over a week with constant use on the way to work at breaks and in the evening,I was someone who only bought it because I am going abroad and my books are normally quite heavy but I didn't expect to be quite so addicted to it,I haven't been able to put it down yet and I have downloaded over 10 pages of book listings and barely touched the kindles capacity so takes literally hundreds to fill at this rate,very happy with it and so easy to use even though I'm not especially techy!!!!

Marianne Harry,1.0 out of 5 stars,Shouldn’t have purchased,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 May 2020,"This is my 4th Kindle and I have to say my original kindle, which had no internal light, was better than this one. As my library is 2000+ books and documents and my existing paperwhite kindle was struggling, I up-graded to a new 32GB paperwhite. Well it arrived on Monday and it is now Saturday and I’m still trying to get my books downloaded. Not only do you have to download each book/document separately but it has now decided partway through that the reminder of my library cannot download. Battery is also considerably worse than previous models. I have to have mine charging at all times whilst trying to download my library. Goodness knows what it will be like when I manage to be able to read a book! I don’t know what is wrong with this model but if you cannot cope with stressful conditions DON’T buy this Kindle."
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I'd never bought it. It's much more complicated than my first Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2020,"I wish I'd never bought it. My old Kindle was losing battery very quickly so it needed replacing. However my old Kindle was very easy to navigate and this one is anything but.On my old Kindle when I'd finished reading a book it was very simple to archive it.  This one makes everything complicated and doesn't appear to have 'archive' as an option, only a read list. When I go to the 'unread' list it includes the 'read' books.On my old Kindle it was very easy to see what books haven't yet been read and on this one.......I don't need the light ever so have no comments."
Russem,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2020,"I love reading and have always said that I didn’t believe I could ever ‘go’ for an e-reader, always preferring to hold and turn the pages of ‘real’ books.Until this year.For the last few months the idea of getting a Kindle kept on growing, partly for convenience during this year of the virus restrictions but also with a view to getting back out for holidays once again and travelling light, packing a Kindle loaded with umpteen books instead of heavy paperbacks.So, I treated myself, and wow, it really is brilliant."
AltonBob,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth connection useless,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 February 2020,I bought this to replace my existing paperwhite as I wanted to use audible via bluetooth headphones.

Uncle Toby,5.0 out of 5 stars,As good as previous models,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 August 2020,"This is now my third Kindle. When the screen broke (after several years) on No.2 I did consider looking at other devices but decided to stick with Kindle because a) I have built up quite a library of Kindle books, and b) there is absolutely nothing wrong with the Kindle as a way of carrying around and reading books in any setting. I have particularly valued having a French dictionary downloaded - the ability to tap on an unfamiliar word and find the meaning (and often the idiom) has made reading in French a far easier experience."
Enchanted England - sarahNet,4.0 out of 5 stars,Neat Kit for an online library,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 December 2020,"This kindle was ordered to replace a previous early version and to avoid having to use the kindle app on an I-pad where its not so straightforward to buy and download books.Possibly I should have spent more and gone for the colour version - this has a monochrome display that destroys jewel-like book covers.More importantly I find the the touch screen is not that accurate - which has surprised this reader as the earlier kindle was excellent. Still - the screen is clear and bright without glare and the Kindle is excellent place to store tomes such as dictionaries, thesaurus etc that would otherwise take up valuable shelf space at home or work."
Jax,4.0 out of 5 stars,make It easier to get going,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 May 2019,"I’ve had other eReaders but this is my first Kindle. Surprised at how small it is but display looks clear. Tapping left side of screen doesn’t go back a page despite instructions saying it should, but swiping seems to do it.No instruction book enclosed (why?) but did find it online.Shame it seems to have been written by someone who is a Kindle expert as it’s pitched way above beginner level - took me ages to work out how to buy a book as I just assumed it was linked to my Amazon account.Come on guys - a lot of the stuff that’s in there is not going to be used by many readers - I don’t want magazines etc, but I’ll use the WiFi to download books so why not do a guide that has the basics to get going at the start, then the more advanced stuff later."
Gary H,3.0 out of 5 stars,Poor design and really needs improving,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2020,"I upgraded from my 6 year old kindle as I wanted one with a light.  I'm happy with the new kindle in this respect, light can be adjusted easily and it is inoffensive and ""soft""However, three really annoying things for me are:1) No USB-C!!!!  Sick of this. Why are Amazon still using a micro usb?  I would have refunded but didnt have an opportunity on this occasion.2) My old kindle has the same issue as this. If you drop it in bed or something brushes the screen when it is on, the font size decreases. Every single time. I wish there was a way to lock the font size and settings.3) Why why why put the power button at the bottom? Where your hand and fingers often rest, or the device itself sits when being used? Why not have it on top or a switch or something else? It is so so easy to turn off by mistake.It is OK.I definitely do not recommend this if you're upgrading. But I do if it is your first kindle"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Died just outside the guarantee.  Update - came back to life a day later after several resets!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2019,"Made it to a year and a couple of days so just outside the replacement window and then died.  Wouldn't charge.  None of the fixes I googled worked.  Save your money and try something else.  Can't recommend.After several google searches and recharging, resetting, recharging, resetting several times, a day later it burst back to life.  Had a message from Kindle Support offering help - they called the wrong number rather than the one set up as my default but at least they tried - but emailed with instructions of how to contact them so am impressed with their customer service as they just did it off my recommendation.  Have changed my rating to 4 stars from the 1 I had given it. It is a good product, when it is working.  Bought for my 87 year old mother who is totally non technical and it is intuitive enough that she is just about coping with it!"
john davies,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not disappointed !,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 February 2021,"Bought this as a replacement for an ageing (and damaged) Kindle 4 and I have to say I’m really impressed . If you’re familiar with an IPad or similar device , then you will appreciate the swipe screen compared to the older Kindle 4 . In addition , the functionality is great with the bonus of really good battery life.I really can’t fault this purchase and whilst a lot more expensive than the older models , you get what you pay for.Go for the with-ads version as it’s slightly cheaper and the ads themselves are only on the Home Screen when starting up and they are simply Amazon marketing messages. No big deal"
Linda J,5.0 out of 5 stars,Prefer the old version,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 September 2020,"I am really disappointed that this version does not ‘go to sleep/wake up’ when I close/open the cover,  like my original (6 years) paper white did. I have to turn it off/on each time, and swipe to wake screen 😤 and the battery doesn’t last as long!!There is no ‘picture’ on screen at wake up, just adverts on the screen!!The only good bit is the storage capacity.I only purchased a new one as my original no longer connects to the WiFi, hubby’s does (his is same age) so internet is working.Couldn’t find anywhere on Amazon site to see if I could get it repaired ☹️"
Chris&Cath,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing product. Get it without ads!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2021,"What a game changer. I’ve never been much of a reader. Truly only ever read homework and such. Never read anything for fun. Got the Harry Potter books for Christmas and got very into reading. After book 5 I waited for this to be on sale and read the rest on the kindle. Now I spend less money on books, my wrist don’t hurt, I can find a comfortable reading position which don’t exist with a physical book AND I can read in the bath, on the beach, train or plane. When it dies I’ll buy a new one. What a time to be alive!"
mrs alison jeffrey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great new lighter version,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2019,"Gift to replace my 2 year old Paperwhite of which I had “dinked” the screen slightly: still useable but irritated me!This one is even lighter and slightly smaller : I had to buy a new magnetic cover to fit but that was t really an issue as my old one was some years old and quite battered and loose.I love the Paperwhite with the built in light: so convenient. Battery life seems good. Change of font sizes and styles is great, esprcially when your eyes are a bit tired at night. This edition is supposedly waterproof but I’ve yet to try it and also audible is easier by headphones.....again not yet tried.  I’m confident they both will though!Don’t be put put off by “special offers”: there are no interruptions to your reading, simply a related Kindle advert on opening the gadget, that’s it.Highly recommend for any reader."
Zippo,1.0 out of 5 stars,Check it doesn’t lose charge quickly,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 February 2019,This is the third one. First two lost charge very quicklyLots of hassle and pretty poor customer service for second return.So far third one is OK. Bit annoying that can’t just get the original one anymore. Also felt the “with offers” is misleading and a rip off.
Julie C H,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 December 2020,"I bought this to go on holiday with and I wasn't disappointed.  It holds loads of books, I must have about 40 on there at the min.  Stays charged for ages, its only been charged 3 times since I've had it and I used it pretty much every day.  I went for the waterproof one and I'm glad I did as the screen is flat so no areas for sand to get stuck in and its east to wipe clean with a sanitizing wipe."
Joanne Thomas,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love it !,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 October 2020,"Decided to buy this after downloading a load of books for a recent holiday to my Amazon Fire tablet, only to discover the glare on the screen made it impossible to read them.  It's fabulous!  A really nice size and very lightweight.  Got the Plum colour which I love !  Still getting to grips a little with the functions as it's so different from any other devices I have, but I'm going to be doing a lot more reading now that I have this wonderful device!  (I already have hundreds of books, so switching to a Kindle was long overdue.)The only thing is, I'm struggling to work out which case to buy to go with it - don't want to spend  a fortune on the leather one, but it doesn't seem clear at all which ones will fit this.  Any advice most welcome !"
Mrs Deborah-Ann Kerr,4.0 out of 5 stars,Just okay,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 May 2019,"I have been using a Kindle for many, many years now and due to my previous device taking a long time to charge, I decided to buy a new Kindle.  I was going to buy the Oasis but really could not warrant the price so opted for the Paperwhite.  It's fine but, to be honest, I prefer my old one.  Yes it's light, yes it's got an in-built light but I really liked the page turn buttons on the the edge of the device (which was the only reason I really wanted the Oasis).  It is so easy to turn more than one page at a time, not easy to go back a page and really annoying when you lay your Kindle down for a second and if you touch the screen when you pick it up again you have no idea how many pages it's jumped forward because you have accidentally touched the screen.  I'm happy enough with the Paperwhite, i'd just like to go back to turning the page with a button!"
Angus,5.0 out of 5 stars,Slight step backwards,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2020,The reading experience is good. The screen and backlight are miles ahead if my old kindle keyboard.However I do have a couple of problems.It won't talk to my pc. It's the only usb device that won't and that irks me. Tried all the troubleshooting to no avail.The power button is exactly where my pinkie naturally sits while holding the device and so I either hold it with mild discomfort or switch it off accidentally.The touchscreen is a gimmick. It's unresponsive and serves very little practicable usage. I'd rather have buttons.Overall it's good. Honestly. I'm  being picky but slightly disappointed overall. If my kindle keyboard was still available  and had the backlight I'd buy it before this.
Mike Wedge,4.0 out of 5 stars,At last I can read in the dark or in the spa!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2020,"I love my Kindle, always have. It feels like a book but is so much easier to use and to read. This is my second, the first was an early model with no back light and absolutely no water protection. Now I can read wherever I am, and as always finishing a book makes me search for another straight away.The only reason it loses one star for me is that I have to tap the screen on the right-hand side to go to the next page. Scenario: when using it one-handed with my left hand (the right being occupied with a glass of suitable refreshment), I can't turn the page, unlike the ancient model which had a button on each side. But on the scale of life it's hardly a train crash. Love it"
Christa,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great device, but opt out of special offers!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 February 2019,"I received a new Kindle Paperwhite as a birthday present after my old device broke. The new version is really nice, though I don't understand why tabs have to be moved around - and why is there no way to see all unread books?However, I LOATHED the ""special offers"": in return for saving £10 on the initial price, you are forced to view whatever latest offers Amazon proffers to you - books, Kindle accessories, etc. The offers are on the screensaver, AND on the initial screen you get before you can enter your Kindle. So annoying! After one month of alternating offers of books I would never read and accessories I didn't need, I figured out how to opt out of this invasive ""service"". Pay £10, and the unwanted ads cease. I'm looking forward to getting a small bit of privacy back."
Neal,5.0 out of 5 stars,Superb updated model,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 November 2018,"Love the new model though.  My two previous Kindles performed admirably, however the increased capacity and being waterproof tempted me into an update. Roll on the holiday and reading by the pool without worry."
Emily Clifford,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant! Sustainable,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 July 2019,"I love my new kindle.I’ve stopped watching tv and I now read instead. I get through 1-2 books a week and with them ranging from 6-10£ (Hard copy) per book it gets expensive.Kindle is a cheaper, more sustainable way to be able to read a book. No delivery time when waiting for the book as it gets “delivered” right away to your kindle for download.The books on kindle are cheaper than hard copies saving ££.Free reading samples.Great suggestions.Only downside is the button, it’s in the exact spot where I put my baby finger to support whilst reading, so it sometimes locks me out.I probably wouldn’t pay the full price for the item, but that’s due to me getting it for an amazing price on prime day! I also don’t think the battery lasts as long as they say but that could be due to my excessive reading habits."
Em,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am a convert,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 March 2020,"I am ashamed to say that even though I am a dedicated real book lover, I am a convert to what I thought was the dark arts of the kindle. It is lightweight, fits in my bag with no trouble and is as easy to read as a real book. I can zoom in to make the print bigger if I need to and it is clear regardless of the light conditions and I don't need to worry about losing my bookmark.  Despite what some reviews said, they battery life is more than enough for my heavy reading habit. The only negative I can find so far is that it doesn't smell like a real book."
Sue,1.0 out of 5 stars,So hard to remove a book from the device and the covers do not download.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 March 2021,My old kindle let me remove a book from it without deleting it from the cloud. This only give me the option of deleting it permanently with a warning that if I want to re-read it I'll have to buy it again!!!It also is very bad at downloading the books cover so I'm left with just the books name and the author's name.It has frozen so many times that I've had to return it to factory settings then start the whole process of setting it up again so that I have now given up on it completely.
LUCY P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing for a 1st time user!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 August 2019,"Truthfully, I was almost put off by some of the negative reviews but I can honestly say - I'm so glad I wasn't. I have argued with myself time and time again about switching to an e-reader because my love for paperback was so strong, I wasn't sure if anything could live up to the expectation.This does. By a mile. It's sleek, it's easy to hold for long periods of time, the five LED lights make it super easy to change the lighting to suit your eyes and the import of my library was quick and efficient. Although I will note that I have a very small library so I couldn't comment on the import of a larger volume of books.Overall, if you're thinking about making the switch, this is the model I would say to go for. The waterproofing features give you a wider range of reading opportunities and it is just a pleasure to hold and read on."
Mrs L,4.0 out of 5 stars,Could be better,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 August 2020,"If I am honest not quite a good as my last paperwhite but I needed an update. It is still very good but a few issues e.g. accidentally turning the page due to the screen been completely flat, the light just doesn't seem as natural as it did on my previous model and I am trying to get to grips with the library and home page. I also thought it would be a bit speedier when accessing the store etc but it seems to be the same as the old model and sometimes lags when selecting titles or waking up the kindle etc.  I have only had for a month so I am hoping that a bit of practice will help me get used to it."
pinkmouse,5.0 out of 5 stars,What’s not to love,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2019,"It took a little while to adapt to my snazzy new kindle as my old (v.old) model was steam driven. It even had a dinky keyboard at the bottom of the screen and no built in light.... So you can tell how ancient it is, possibly one of the first ones on the market and I cried when it died. The new one is so light, in all ways! The built back light is excellent and easy to adjust. The navigation is intuitive and easy to navigate even for a non geek like me, so what’s not to love. Plus it is mega-lightweight so easy to pop in a pocket or bag without being weighed down. Best of all it seems to have a long battery life, to the extent I occasionally forget to charge it up.The set-up is easy to customise to your own particular taste and easy to change should you change your mind."
Plan134,4.0 out of 5 stars,Hate the onscreen advertising,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 September 2020,"Unfortunately, I dropped my Kindle Paperwhite of 7 years, in the bath!  I immediately ordered a new, waterproof version and can't fault the seamless switch of my library from old to new device.  Set up was perfect.  However, when I switched my old Kindle on I got a screensaver of pencils which I loved.  Now, I get bombarded by adverts for new book releases and, try as I might, I can't switch this setting off.  I absolutely hate being advertised to every time I pick up to read but, as far as the Kindle itself goes, it's perfect."
Ann Pen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you have dyslexia, go for it!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 March 2019,"I’m new to reading for leisure. I’m dyslexic and have never found ready pleasurable. But a couple of years ago I found a book that I wanted to read and was not to difficult (no complicated plots) and it grew from there, now I really enjoy reading. However, taking books and holiday and storing books has got a bit inconvenient for space. I  Avoided a kindle previously as thought it would be difficult to read from as I find computer screens problematic but I needent of worried. It is light, easy to ready in all lights. You can adjust font size to the right one for you. You can even change the font types. I can’t compare to other kindles as this is my first but I am really happy with it and traveling with books no longer takes up essential make up space lol."
film mad fan,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Dont buy a paperwhite  , and retrain staff to say same thing........",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 January 2020,"Worst item ever father in law bought  my daughter one .two days later tried to st up would not connect to wifi, so I ordered  a replacement  same thing happened  again. So rang up to sort out explained  that father in law  had bought it and could I return  second one. After the first person had said no problem to return original one the customer service said the account holder had to sort it, even though first person said no problem. So  instructions  need to be updated and retraining. They actually said there has been problems with not connecting.  So not fit for use . Waiting for in laws to tell me they have been refunded . So an expensive item that was supposed  to be a nice surprise for my daughter....... not happy"
Mrs. P. M. Roberts,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not my favourite kindle by a long way!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 March 2020,"I can’t find books I’ve ordered, the first page of library doesn’t have latest purchases on it? Can’t remember then what I’ve ordered, so have to go on amazon to find what the books are called, there doesn’t seem to be any order to the books! Battery life is worse than my last 3 kindles, one of the reasons I bought a new reader! Not very happy at all with it!"
Woozlebear,4.0 out of 5 stars,Purchased at A Good Price,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 November 2020,Purchased to replace an older model for my wife. The touch screen is quite sensative and if touched in the wrong place can be problamatic. Difficult to find the current book you are reading at times because when you close the device it does not always return to the last page read when reopened. Will take some getting used to. Would have liked a paper guide instead of the on device guide to save having to go back and forth on the device when learning how to use a feature. Nice clear easy to read print and the light is great.
Daniel Nicholls,3.0 out of 5 stars,A nice E-Reader with some confusing design choices...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 January 2020,The overall reader is fine when you're actually in a book but navigating the menus is one of the most tedious tasks there is. You can't search for a book in your library so instead you must swipe through endless pages to find what you want. Add to this the fact it's an e-ink display and you're left with one of the slowest tasks possible on a digital device. And that's when it works. Half the time it thinks me swiping to the next page is me asking to open a book!The power button on the bottom of the device is just idiotic. I'm sure that Amazon didn't consider that people hold their devices down there because more than once I've switched the thing off whilst trying to change my grip.The device is fine but lacklustre with some truly mind boggling design choices.
Blue Yonder,5.0 out of 5 stars,KINDLE PAPERWHITE GENERATION 10.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 February 2020,"I bought this to replace my 2013 purchase, which sadly gave up the ghost. Not much difference, but there are subtle updates. Suffice to say I am a confirmed Kindle lover. Can’t understand anyone wanting to go back to hardback or paperback versions.Advantages are: 1) The ability to carry a a whole library of books around in something not much larger than a passport. 2) Not having to carry a load of books in your luggage when going on holiday. 3) Being able to read in the middle of the night without turning on the light."
Ailish,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rekindled my love for reading.....,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 April 2020,I always loved holding a book but was getting a bit sick of straining my eyes in the dark and having a house full of books. The built in light is amazing for and the battery lasts absolutely ages! It seems a bit slow when you’re looking through the store on it so I normally pick my books out on my phone. I’ve never got it out my hand I love it.
Bee,5.0 out of 5 stars,Outstanding,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2019,"Bought this as a gift for a cousin who loves to read. She has been a kindle subscriber for many years but used her iPad to read. I thought I would treat her to this for her birthday as recently she’s been unable to read more than a few minutes on her iPad as she gets terribly dry eyes from the screen. Once she got this she hasn’t put it down. She tells me that the reading experience is much better than anything other than a physical book, she loves the way the text looks, she’s loves that it’s lighter and easier to hold than an iPad mini, she loves that the battery lasts for ages and ages, but most of all she isn’t getting the eye problems while using it. She told me it’s the best gift she’s been given in many many years!!"
Andrew,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Paperwhite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 August 2019,"I have been using a Nook e-reader for several years but, as it was showing its age, decided to take advantage of the Prime offer and purchased a Kindle Paperwhite. I will not list the various features, Amazon are more than capable of promoting the product themselves, but thought it may be of interest to some to highlight the features I like compared to the Nook, and oneI don’t.Plus points:Thinner and lighterBacklit screen displayWaterproof (I read in the bath)Synch with Kindle installed on my phoneNegative points:Does not read epub. OK, I know I can convert them but I consider this a serious omission."
Danny Warrick,2.0 out of 5 stars,"The battery sucks - more literally the device sucks power oh, so fast!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 July 2019,"Had the early version, but screen was starting to breakdown. Great to hold, light and a good size. The touch screen works well, which I had been worried about, as I'd used an early version of a friend's, which seemed overly sensitive. This screen sensitivity is good. I  have two issues with the device, one I was prepared for as there are quite a few comments online about the poor battery performance and the other is listening to books. The charge ran out after 4 days of me reading it for an hour or so at night! I found a site online that tells you how to maximise its battery (the fact this advice exists tells you a lot), which basically is reduce the devices functionality, unless you expressly need to use it, but reduce it immediately after! My other issue is audible books, I'm read slowly,so listen to a great deal of books and have quite an extensive library that I've bought over the years, the majority being mp3, so I can listen in the car. These I can't use on the Kindle because it will only store Audible books - come on Amazon aren't you making enough money? Oh, and pay the extra £10 for the non-special version or your device is another way of Amazon drowning you in adverts!"
Bookworm,3.0 out of 5 stars,Compact & Practical,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 September 2020,"This Kindle is a compact size and is easy to hold.  There is a built in light which is very handy.  On the negative, it took a while to set-up, even though I linked it to my Amazon account.  It sometimes jumps pages and does not show all the notes or highlights that I have made; even though I have followed the instructions.  I made about 30 notes and highlights and when I went to view them, only one note appeared.  This meant that I had to physically flick through all the pages to find them."
Spookella,5.0 out of 5 stars,OK if you have no option other than to upgrade.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 March 2021,"Happy with my new Kindle but I don't like it as much a much as my old style one. Since my old one couldn't connect via my new high speed broadband I had no option but to upgrade.  The battery length isn't as good as my old one even though that had a light built into the cover. The touch screen is annoying as I can't use it one handed like my old one.  All in all, it is a good product but it takes a bit of getting used to navigating the screens.  I can also see my husband's purchases which I don't like."
Anne Walker,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Love it, miss the clock",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2020,"Upgraded my kindle to this one. Just as good as the old one (which I loved) the store is a little easier to access and I like the addition of the link to the next book in the series.  My only gripe which has cost one star as I relied on it whilst reading in bed is that the clock has disappeared at the top of the page.  I can get so engrossed in reading sometimes I can read into the early hours, the clock on the old one was invaluable to stop me reading through the night. I've looked through the settings and cant find anywhere to put the time back at the top of the page.  Amazon, please fix this with a software update."
Wayne Loftus,5.0 out of 5 stars,Glad I Made The Switch,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 April 2020,"I resisted getting a Kindle for years. I love reading, and always wanted to have a real book in my hands. I'm so glad I made the switch, though. It's like reading a real book, but I can do it with the lights off. Battery life is fantastic, even when using it very regularly.The only problem I have with the product overall is that the touchscreen is a bit slow, and when you're reading a book it normally turns the page when you are trying to bring down the options menu.I have the 8GB version, and I've about 140 books on it with plenty of room to spare. Unless you need to have a few thousand technical manuals, work documents, etc, the 8GB is probably all you'll need."
Derek O,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Read in the dark, or in bright sunlight!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2018,"This my 4th Kindle (6th in the family) and I would be lost without it. My previous Kindle Paperwhite lasted for 5 years before it started developing faults, which could not be repaired. The storage is fantastic, ideal for holidays, you don’t have to carry your weight in books if you are an avid reader like me. I haven’t had occasion to check the claim that it is waterproof, and probably never will. The main advantages of the Paperwhite are, 1) the ability to read it in bed, 2) easily held in one hand, 3) page turning by touching the screen, 4) no need to have a light on which could disturb anyone else. The reason I only gave 4 stars is because there was s fault on one of the functions which took a few weeks to resolve, it is now working exactly as it should and I am hoping that this one (10th generation) lasts as long as my previous Kindle (6th generation)."
Mikehtc,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 October 2019,I have used a Kindle Keyboard for over 7 years and been delighted with it. The Paperwhite is poor in comparison because the touch-screen is nowhere near as good as the buttons. To turn the page forward you tap the right-hand side of the screen but sometimes it takes a light touch and other times it takes two or three harder touches. To go back a page you are supposed to touch the left-hand side of the screen but that just does not work. Rather you have to swipe from right to left. If my Kindle Keyboard was still working I would use that and send the Paperwhite back!
MamaMaz,3.0 out of 5 stars,10th Generation Kindle Paperwhite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 September 2020,"I’ve had the same Kindle Paperwhite since 2013 and being an avid reader found it to be a great little piece of technology. Recently it started to develop a few niggles so I decided to purchase a new one.  Unfortunately after 7 years of happy reading on my old device, I find the latest Paperwhite disappointing.The screen is creamy-white which I find glaring and prefer the clear whiteness of my original model.Page-turning seems to be slower and navigation takes longer.I don’t read in the bath or pool and therefore find no benefit from it being waterproof.Although easy to hold, when encased in the compatible leather cover I find the power switch awkward to locate. Irritatingly the cover moves when turned back during reading due to its flimsiness.If I didn’t have to change my original device, I definitely wouldn’t have bothered to upgrade to the 10th Generation Kindle Paperwhite."
Allan conway,3.0 out of 5 stars,Bluetooth function,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 July 2020,"When I first set up the paper white it couldn't find any bluetooth devices to pair with, despite having my apple iPhone, air pods and macbook pro next to it. I eventually got through to a technician who for some 45 minutes, had me doing various things including restarting, updating, turning bluetooth on/off etc.Eventually he decided it should be replaced. I next day phoned another technician ( not trusting the first). He said the paper white didn't have bluetooth!). I then went to no less than 5 Hermes stations to send the paper white back. The first wouldn't accept this size of parcel, the second couldn't get their mobile to work, the third had stopped taking Hermes, the fourth didn't recognise the QR code. The fifth had run out of blue receipt slips, but agreed to take it anyway. I then got a new paper white. Same problem with bluetooth. Finally spoke to a knowledgeable technician who said the bluetooth would only synch with car audio, speakers or headphones, but not air pods as they had a speaker. So in fact the first paper white was fine. WHY don't amazon explain the bluetooth function? The forum has others with same problem.The case for paper white is not as good as old hard case which could fold in the middle making holding easier."
Bill K,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A good device, but take the adverts about its water resistance with a pinch of salt.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 January 2019,"Delivery was quick and trouble free (I used Amazon Locker). The dictionary works differently from my previous Kindle (a 4th generation with scroll buttons). I remember that it took a long time to get comfortable with that one, so I guess I'll get used to this one. I use my Kindle mainly for reading French books and the dictionary is very important to me. The translation feature is a nice enhancement, but it's annoying that it keeps forgetting what languages I'm using.It now supports Dutch dictionaries properly, which is a great improvement.The one criticism is that it is not as waterproof as the advertisements lead you to believe. Far from reading in the pool or on the beach as the pictures show, the instructions that actually come with the Kindle say that it can withstand brief accidental dips in fresh water and that it should be kept away from salt or chlorinated water, and that if it is accidentally immersed, it should be switched off and stood on end to dry.  I feel that the adverts were somewhat misleading."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Does what it says,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 November 2020,"I bought this to replace my second Oasis.  I am not a lover of touch screen and the oasis was waterproof and had touch screen or buttons.  My best kindle was the original which lasted far longer than the newer models and only had button controls.  This is a nice model and I have given up on the hope of Amazon making a cheap button control model again so this time went for paperwhite.  It is good, does exactly what is advertised, in particular it is light weight and I suspect I will grow to love it."
Priyanka Singh,1.0 out of 5 stars,BUILT TO LAST - ONLY TILL ITS 1YR WARRANTY PERIOD,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2021,"My old kindle was well used and well loved for 10yrs till it was lost.The new kindle didn't function very well from the start. The page back function often landed at random pages. Now, after very little use (only 4 books read) it simply stopped charging, literally 3 months past it's 12 months warranty!!Unsurprisingly there is no 'BUILD QUALITY'category in the review to grade. Need less to say from me it would be a ZERO."
M. Baker,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Beware new waterproof kindle,-downgrade!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 February 2019,"Beware the new waterproof version of kindle. It's definitely not an upgrade! The touch screen is slow and often fails, the battery won't even last 2 weeks of 2 hr daily usage (the first one lasted a week between charges, so got a replacement which is only marginally better!) my old one would last about a month. The processes (like adding a book to a collection) take over 30 seconds and even just turning it on seems to take an extra 10 seconds to ""warm up"" my precious 2 year old kindle didn't need this warm up time! Genuinely disappointed that it's the worst version of kindle so far. Topped off by utterly useless customer service. Amazon are heading downhill."
T. Harland,1.0 out of 5 stars,FRUSTRATED BEYOND BELIEF!!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 February 2019,"I loved my Kindle Paperwhite. I suffer from carpel tunnel syndrome and it is much less painful to hold than a normal book. However, after just a few month's use, I didn't use us for a while (3 months) and a battery symbol with an exclamation mark appeared on the screen. On attempting all the advice found on Google (lengthy charging then holding button for 40 seconds, then 5, numerous times; buying a new charge plug and lead) nothing had changed and it still wouldn't start up. My only conclusion that the battery had discharged so much that it could not be revived. I found a local technician who said he could replace the battery for £60 (hardly worth it as the sell for £99. So I researched replacing it myself which, from youTube, appeared to be fairly straight forward. However, to order the battery I would have to know which version Paperwhite, but all I could find was that this information (even on Wiki) was confusing and conflicting. I decided to brave it and take my Paperwhite apart to actually see what battery was inside only to find, following much more research, a replacement for this battery is NOT sold by Amazon and indeed, I could only find one supplier through eBay that sold this item in Taiwan and that it was out of stock. WHY, OH WHY, AMAZON, DO YOU SELL SOMETHING THAT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO GET REPAIRED – EVEN WITH SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS A BATTERY???? I AM INSENSED BY THE STUPIDITY OF THIS!!!"
Dawn,1.0 out of 5 stars,Nothing but trouble and frustration,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 June 2020,"I have had nothing but trouble with my second paperwhite.  It re-boots several times a day for no apparent reason.  You have to filter now to put things into collections and often when you add a book into a collection it doesn’t stay there.  As this is how I separate books I have read from those I have not, it is frustrating.  When turning the over sensitive pages, you often end up opening a book (which then makes it appear under the recents filter just because you opened it).  Holding with fingers at the bottom often results in turning the whole thing off.  Never had these issues with the previous paperwhite so so called improvements are not improvements at all."
Skophel,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not compatible with all kindle books,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 May 2020,"I bought this for my daughter, but will be returning it, as it's a pointless waste of money. The first book I bought for it continually produced an error message (something that 90 mins of Amazon Customer Service assistance couldn't rectify), the book I bought for her as a replacement for the first disappointment isn't compatible with the Paperwhite. That's right, though sold as a Kindle book, it is incompatible with a Kindle.Books listed by Amazon as paperback and hardback have a dropdown menu with info on what versions of those formats are available, but the Kindle line doesn't. So it's all too easy to buy a book (especially with 1-click), only to discover it can't be read on your device."
Michelle,3.0 out of 5 stars,First time buyer and not exactly as I expected,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 May 2020,"This is the first time I bought a Kindle after wanting one for a long time, I thought I would opt for one of the latest models. The fact that you have thousands of books at your fingertips is great as I am an avid reader, and it is very portable and easy to hold. However I was disappointed with how it functions, it is slower to respond than I expected and the transitions between pages are glitchy. I thought it would be seamless but as I said I am a new user so I assume this is the norm. I'm sure I will get on with it, but for the price I expected a more seamless experience."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy I finally bought it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 September 2020,"I love to read and at the start of lockdown I finished my books and it was difficult to get new ones so I took the plunge and bought a kindle. I am annoyed I didn't do it sooner. I always thought I would miss a physical book but I really don't. The easy and convenience of a kindle is incredible. I can search so many books in an instance, I get book suggestions based on my recent reads and I can sample a book before buying it to see if its the perfect book for me. I have read so many new books because of it. The battery lasts for weeks, it is so light and easy to use. I would suggest buying a cover to protect it and offers a little more grip. Its like having a protective cover on your phone. I am really am so happy I bought it."
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Very light and visible in bright sunlight,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 August 2019,"I bought this for the visibility in all light conditions and for the battery life. When first loading it with books I was a bit disappointed with the battery life but now it is loaded it retains charge for days if used for reading books only. It can be used to listen to audio books via a Bluetooth earphone but this did seem to use the battery quickly. The display is black and white, easily visible but for general use I prefer my kindle fire as some books contain illustrations that show better on the fire. Much lighter to carry the paper white and ideal for waiting rooms. The touchscreen needs more pressure than my other kindles which took a bit of getting used to."
Tony Addyman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very happy,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 May 2019,"After reading some less than favourable reviews I was uncertain about getting a Kindle. I had been using a Web browser or Android KIndle app successfully for years. However, I am very pleased with my Kindle. The battery life is good. I have it in aeroplane mode most of the time, and have read 6 Faith Martin books and only used about 50% of the battery. I have not really been aware of the built in light. In poor light the page has a ""glow"", so you can read easily, but you are not aware of the source of the light. At least, I am not. I found that there was a bit of a lag when using the touch screen during the original setup, but it hasn't been a problem when using the Kindle to read books, which is why I bought it after all. Having said that, I have found sending documents to my Kindle via email to be very easy, so it may find use as a store for electronic documents that I want to have easily accessible."
NEIL-A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Reader,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 April 2019,"I had trouble setting it up and it can be quite confusing talking through things on the phone (as there are many devices under Paperwhite) I had to get help registering,it would not work when following instructions to register(the lady did sort it on her end.much of my problems (with PDF transfer) were down to lack of personal knowledge ---Although without help I could not send via the Email@kindle, I ended up using the USB and managed it that way.In all, it pays to persevere. As far as my reading experience-I am happy)I find the black background with white fonts is good on the eyes... something for all tastes and needs. It takes a while to get used to the format(taps rather than presses to turn pages etc. Also, I bought the leather ''Amazon cover'' second hand''. People complain of easy marking but it is easy to resurface it by rubbing with a rough cloth, tee shirt, on the carpet,etc, brings it back to a new matt finish"
David F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best e-reader there is,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 April 2019,"Love the kindle paperwhite. Screen is basically the same as model before but has no raised surround so really easy to wipe clean. Now waterproof which means I don't have to worry when reading while soaking in the bath. Plus now twice the storage and will Bluetooth connect to another device if you listen to audio books. The only thing that let's it down is the charging port, the lead amazon sends just does not fit properly or work as I tried a couple but I found that if I used a Samsung charger it worked great and Amazon sent me a new Samsung charger at my request so problem solved. I would still highly recommend the latest kindle paperwhite as it is still an amazing e-reader. Thanks"
Jacqui,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lovely new Kindle Paperwhite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 August 2019,"This is my third kindle and replaces my much used, and loved, kindle keyboard, which had a failing battery. However I am very pleased with this new device. It is smaller and lighter even than my 2 year old paperwhite, and the light is wonderful, very clear text in all lighting situations, from darkness through twilight to bright sunshine. There is no shading at all.  I bought the device with “special offers” and don’t find the constant recommendations particularly troublesome. The touchscreen is rather sensitive, I really would prefer page turn buttons, but couldn’t justify the cost of a kindle voyage. Overall though, I do like it very much and would definitely recommend this new paperwhite."
watanabe43,5.0 out of 5 stars,A fantastic upgrade on an original Kindle.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 December 2018,"I bought this during Black Friday to replace my aging Kindle 4.0 and it has been a revelation. The backlight makes reading so much more pleasurable both in daylight and darkness, I never found the greyness of the original particularly natural and this feels much more like a normal book. My old Kindle had a very good case with a built in flip out light but cannot compare to a backlight. I haven't made use of the waterproofing yet but look forward to reading in the bath! The only negative I have found is that the Special Offers are not compatible with an 'automatic' read/wake case as there is an additional step of awkwardly swiping the screen. As a result I had to pay the extra £10 to remove the ads but this is not enough to mark the product down. Lovely little piece of kit."
D S Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,A superb kindle even for the elderly generation!...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2020,This kindle was bought as a Christmas present for my mother-in-law and she loves it!.. She is 87 years old and she loves reading and bought paperback books on a weekly basis which mounted up and obviously causes storage problems. We didn't know what to buy her for Christmas and the day before Christmas Eve asked her if she would like one.. We were pleasantly surprised when she agreed and no more trawling around shops to find suitable books!...So Amazon thank you for your superb ordering and delivery service andA for making Christmas special for our mom.
indyelvis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow!!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 May 2019,"Wow! Wow! Just wow!First, Kindle:I was one of those; Books should be paper. The feel, the smell, the whatever.(I still kind of am, though)But this is taking The Book to another level. For I love the flexibility of it all.I love reading. But I love reading two-three-four books at the same time. So I turned to iBooks on my iPad/iPhone/Mac. For years.A friend let me borrow his old Kindle and I was sold. The thing about the light is really important. Yes, you can read on an iPad. iBooks works. No problems there. But reading alot, and for a long time, the lights does matter. And nothing is better than the Kindle when it comes to that good, long reading session.Then, Kindle PaperWhite:This is my first Kindle. I bought it from amazon.co.uk (living in Norway - amazon was really helpful when it comes to tax and all; it's all in there when you buy, easy to understand).I ordered it on friday and got it tuesday. DHL, baby!It is mine! I have a Kindle!So small. One thinks; this is too small. But it is not. It is perfect. Perfect in every way. Thin, low weight. Waterproof, they say. I have not tried reading under water, but I have been reading every way possible for three days now, still 47% battery from 54% when delivered.I have big hands and it falls in place perfectly. There is nothing wrong with this. It is all good.I found my favourite J. London (John Barleycorn) and complete short stories by John Steinbeck in the amazon store for $80. I have downloaded a lot of free samples to read for later.I open it up (I bought a Omoton case https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07KG8HYCL/ref=pe_1572281_66412651_cm_rv_eml_rv0_dp ) and have problems putting it down. Hands down.Reading books on my Kindle Paperwhite as an adult is just as fun as it was sneaking into school libraries at night ;)One does not want to quit!My workplace offers free and new massage chairs to it's workers. I am now coming to work two hours early, and leaving two hours late, just to sit in one of those bad boys and read, read, read. And I love it!"
Menace,2.0 out of 5 stars,The Battery will Die if not used for a couple of months,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 April 2020,"This kindle was not as easy to use as the old kindle I previously owned for some years, but it did have a good display when it worked.  Disappointed that when the screen is turned off the battery is still being drained.  The last time I used it was early January, however when I came to use it recently Early April it was completely dead, and of course out of warrenty.  Sorry not impressed."
Sam,4.0 out of 5 stars,Text doesn't justify,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2021,"So, I bought this recently then realised that the text doesn't fully justify, despite fiddling with all the settings. I spoke with customer services and they didn't know what I meant about the alignment of the text and so replaced the Kindle, however, I have the same problem with the new one. What I don't understand is, why to give the option of alignments when clearly Amazon hasn't added it as a viable option. It's a shame because I was upgrading from the 4th gen, which actually had this option. I detest left-justified text (and I'm not the only one! Check out some forums!) and am considering going to another type of reader if this isn't resolved. Open any real book and won't be left-justified, why should my Kindle be so?Finally, as a left-handed person, I am having to get used to swiping the pages forward and tapping for back, which isn't always successful.Apart from these complaints, I can see the Kindle as well built as the previous one, the addition of the light is great and I haven't tested the battery life yet (still may return!)Can I get a manufacturer reply regarding updating the justification to meet the spec of the 4th gen??"
Ollivia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lovely way of reading, especially when you can't sleep",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2019,"I love the way it's so easy to use, and can be held at any angle with one hand. Haven't tested reading it when I'm in the bath yet.  For novels and non-fiction that don't have lots of pictures, it's great, but it only shows pictures in black and white.  I wouldn't use it for recipe books or books that depend on pictures, but otherwise it's brilliant!One thing I do find with the text though - and it's the only downside - I find a lot of errors in the typing in some books, as well as page formatting.  However, if we all send back the issues (press on the word until a message comes up and look for the three dots on the rhs.  Press on them and then report the error) the people who set the text will eventually get the message that these things need to be proof read."
Pat Stephens,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprisingly Good,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 August 2020,"I bought the paperwhite when my old kindle was about to give up the ghost (after 8 years). I was a bit hesitant after reading some reviews, I shouldn't have worried. I love it and should have bought it sooner. It is lighter than my original kindle, meaning I can hold it in one hand rather than two and I am able to read it after dark, a real plus. It charges very quickly, although having said that the battery does last so much longer. I have not tried the waterproof feature yet, so I will reserve judgement until I am in the jacuzzi and, inevitably, drop it. I would thoroughly reccommend it."
Steven W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost the best thing since a real Book,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 April 2020,"Great eBook reader, was a replacement for my original Sony eBook reader.Super lightweight, clear reading screen, even in bright light.It says waterproof, but I don't intend trying this, even for a review.I take mine almost every where, it fits snuggly in to a large pocket, (Inside pocket of my outdoor coat too).Just need to find a nice case for it, (Don't buy the ""OMOTON Kindle Paperwhite Case"", I have had two and the corners keep breaking).I have had this since new, I bought it December 2018, and have only just remembered to do the review."
Kensong,3.0 out of 5 stars,Too many bloody adverts.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 July 2019,"This is very, very similar to my old Paperwhite. Does exactly the sae job in fact, but every time I open it there are adverts for other books and I ave to clear them before I can get to my books. The ad's are lined across the bottom of the screen so to get to my books there are now 3/4 actions instead of just opening the Kindle.. Yes it's light and easy to hold and I can read in bright sunlight or in the dark, it does that beautifully - as did my old one. The touch screen is quick and responsive and easy to use but please ditch the ads. I've bought the kindle obviously I'm going to buy books for it - there is no need to advertise them."
I. Gibson,2.0 out of 5 stars,"Good reading experience, but a step backwards for its technology",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 March 2021,"Bought this as a replacement for my 10-year old Kindle, which finally stopped working. Backlight and weight are an improvement. WiFi connection is extremely frustrating - it will lose connection and require me to restart my home router before reconnecting- despite everywhere wireless device I own working perfectly with the connection.Touch screen controls are a bit fiddly to use at times. The interface is definitely not as intuitive as my old-school Kindle. Responsiveness is not great either - and the amount of time it takes to reboot is painfully slow.The e-ink still works as well on the eyes, so definitely better for reading than a regular tablet. Hopefully Amazon won't abandon this format, but if they continue with it, I think they need to seriously up their game, as when I decide to replace this, I'm going to be looking at alternatives.Also worth noting that the Paperwhite really needs a cover. Not only to protect the screen, but for handling. It feels too light without a cover. With, it's absolutely fine."
PJM,1.0 out of 5 stars,Absolute piece of junk!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 February 2020,"I've had a kindle for many years they are great. I bought this new one last year simply because I cracked the screen on my old one.The new one is a 10 gen device, fully touch screen. I've had more trouble in 6 months that I had with my old one in 10 years. What makes it worse us that you try to talk to Amazon and they make it so hard to ""contact us"" and when you eventually do get to talk to someone its the most frustrating of experiences.I'd never buy one of these again, I am resigned to resetting the device as new whenever it fails to start up... which is frequent.Don't buy, its an absolute piece of junk... what a shame."
SARAH BATTEN,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is a Kindle that should be survive a quick dip.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 June 2020,"Perfect for taking on holiday, on any train/plane journey as can hold more books than you could possibly pack or read.  Light and easy to read and the latest version hopefully waterproof enough to drop in the bath or splash with water, not yet tested.  Good backlight of variable intensity, great range of text size for those who otherwise need reading glasses and plenty of good books available from Amazon ranging from the serious to frivolous and many on offer for £1.00.  Plus books can be shared with family members who also have a kindly."
Julia123,2.0 out of 5 stars,No longer working within 16 months!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 March 2021,"Such a waste of money. I bought this kindle to replace one that Had been my old faithful. After 16 months of limited use, my kindle won’t charge. Tried re-setting but nothing helps. I’ve been offered a measly 15% discount off my next kindle purchase by Amazon. This is so frustrating. It is such an expensive product.the whisper sync never worked either. Really unhappy at the amount I spent thinking I was getting top of the range! Really not worth it."
FunkyFlag,2.0 out of 5 stars,Waterproof but audio/reading link is very poor,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 May 2019,I love reading in the bath and this is perfect. BUT and a fairly big BUT I am far from impressed with the ‘swap between reading and audio’. I already own a lot of Kindle books so am a good customer. When I bought this I decided to re-read books and swap between reading and listening. Audible books are often cheaper if you have bought the Kindle book. Good in theory but not one has synced without several calls to Amazon and in each case a new version the Kindle book has had to be sent. The last time this happened it took FOUR customer service advisors to sort it. I suspect that it affects British customers more than Americans as our versions the Kindle books do not exactly match the recorded version (which tend a to use American words).It is interesting that this is not even something that they ask you to give stars to in this review. My experiences since buying this device is that Amazon do not care at all about their customers.
D. K.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle for Kids is a disaster,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 November 2019,"Got this as a digital reader for a child and it's a disaster. While the hardware is rather better than of previous editions, the added software especially for children account is, in my opinion, violating the anti-monopoly law of EU, as it only allows child to read books purchased in Kindle store. If you add a book from 3rd party provider, they are imported into your library as ""documents"" rather than ""books"", and so you can't share them with children. Obviously it was done so you would purchase all your books at Amazon, and I foresee a huge fine on Amazon for doing that."
T,4.0 out of 5 stars,First Kindle and I'm loving it!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 November 2018,"Purchased the new Kindle a few weeks ago and I'm really enjoying it so far. Loving the cheap deals I can get on books and I'm definitely reading more now than I ever had. The size and weight of it are absolutely perfect.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it's a bit glitchy (which is normal). Otherwise, if you're thinking of buying one, just do it."
CWallis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Greatly helped ability to read because of problems with my vision,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 August 2020,"I use my paperwhite to not only read books but also listen to audio books. I can switch between the two, so say I am listening to an audio book but when I go to bed I dont want to be noisy so I switch to my kindle and it seamlessly switches over.I have a permenent problem with my eyes due to migraine which causes a halo around black text on white backgrounds, but with my kindle I can set it to display white text on a black background which helps a great deal. I can also alter the amount of space in between rows of text and alter the size of text. I cant tell you what a difference this has made to my ability to read, I am so happy.I like to sit in my garden and read and it doesnt matter how sunny it is the text shows up perfectly. I can alter the brightness so that at night when I'm reading in bed I can turn the brightness down so as not to stimulate my brain so I can get to sleep."
Rich McG,5.0 out of 5 stars,A massive step up from 1st gen Paperwhite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 May 2019,"I thought it was about time to upgrade from my first kindle, a 1st generation Paperwhite from 2012. It's still going strong but looking a bit tired, and I have found myself moving back to paper books. With a holiday coming up, though, I wanted the convenience of a kindle... would the new (2018, 10th gen) Paperwhite be enough of an upgrade?Yes, and then some.While I understand many of the features it boasts that are new to me are not new to kindles in general, I am blown away by how sleek this thing is compared to my stone age gadget. The screen resolution is a thing to behold - no more jagged blocky text, and the freedom to use more delicate fonts (begone, hideous Caecilia).Ah, the fonts. One of the real selling points of this device for me was that Amazon have now made it easy to add custom fonts from a computer. I love this, as I'm not a fan of the standard fonts (Bookerly, which my old kindle didn't have, is rather nice though). As soon as I got it I added 10 serif fonts I liked, to make pages look more like those of an actual book. Even better, you can tweak the boldness to make it look just right.Everything is orders of magnitude more responsive than my old kindle. Navigating the store is no longer a trial. The frontlight is totally even. And I love the bezel being flush to the screen.Any downsides? It's a dust and fingerprint magnet. I still wish it had page turn buttons, but now Amazon force you to buy an Oasis if you want those. A colour e-Ink screen would be great but they're still a ways off.As for battery life... I've had it a month, have read 3 books, and it's still on its first charge, with 42% battery left. Pretty excellent in my book!"
Mavis Cook,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good reader on the go,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 November 2018,"Loved the Kindle, light and easy to drop into the handbag or fit in the back pocket for whenever the opportunity arises  to dip into books on the go.Very disappoint by the audio side of it, where there is no jack for head phones, an important preference to have rather than transmitting audio through paring the Kindle with another device which takes away personalized listening on the go. Still finding my way round it.  I maybe a technophobe, but I would like to know if listening to e-books through headphones can be achieved, and that would Be very useful and practical.The HOME button is supposed to give an option where one can download or view the manual, however that's not the case. It would be useful to have this option at hand to refer to for tips on how to use the Kindle efficiently."
operabuff,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 November 2019,"Over  the years I have bought 4 of these, two of which were for presents with which the recipients were delighted. Unfortunately my first one (which I have used for years) has now gone faulty. I cannot get it working again so have invested in a fourth which is at present working perfectly. I usually enjoy reading in bed at night before sleep for which this is just the job. You can just switch it off when you've had enough and them pick up where you left off. There is a massive collection of books so whatever your interests, fiction or otherwise you, are sure to find lots of them."
Grimian,5.0 out of 5 stars,A happy wife means a happy life,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 September 2019,"Bought for my wife as a surprise before a holiday abroad . She is very happy with it being a lot lighter, brighter and easier to read than her original kindle with built in keyboard which has served her well. The only thing she is missing is the ability to turn the page with  buttons as she could do this with one hand on her old one. Whether the addition of buttons would affect it’s  ability to be waterproof, I do not know, but I guess she will have to learn a new technique!We ordered the kindle with a ‘water safe’ case which compliments the kindle well and has so far withstood some intensive poolside reading without any issues. She’s happy so I highly recommended it!"
Denise,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Don’t bother, it breaks and amazon won’t fix it",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 April 2020,"Bought this kindle and loved it although didn’t use it much due to having a lot of paper books to finish reading. The Kindle hadn’t been switched on in a while, when I did turn it on it wouldn’t load past the picture of a kid under a tree. I contacted amazon who said it was under a month out of warranty but here’s 15% off the next one. The first didn’t even last a year so why would I bother buying a second? Expensive reading for one year, so disappointed and annoyed with the customer service."
Mr. Thomas Houston,5.0 out of 5 stars,Well pleased with my purchase,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2020,"First off, I really did like the buttons on the right hand of my old Kindle.But with a little trepidation I started using my Kindle Paperwhite and much to my delight I have found the touch screen easy to work.Only slight downside was that I purchased the Kindle Cover which unfortunately doesn't have an elastic band across the reverse side, which was goot for holding the Kindle.Possibly my previous cover wasn't a branded cover, and therein lies the difference.Overall, we'll pleased and extremely satisfied with my updated version of an old favorite."
John Law,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good but could be better,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2020,"Easy to use as always, bought this one to replace one I dropped in the bath!!!My main complaint is the positioning of the button to turn the device on; it is very sensitive and is placed just where your little finger rest when reading the device (mine does anyway),. you are constantly turning the device off.  A better place for this start button would be on the side or the top.I have made a slide from an A4  gripper that slides easily across and covers the on/off switch - works very well;. Perhaps I should patent it."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect upgrade for long term kindle readers!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 January 2020,"Upgraded my old kindle (the one with side buttons and no keyboard) to this - love having a backlight so I can read in bed without annoying the boyfriend. Battery life is still great, it came with about 40% charge and I only needed to plug it in about 2 weeks later, having done A LOT of reading over the Christmas period.I do agree that the standby button underneath is a bit stupid. I have accidentally pressed it once so far.Love having a touch screen - I actually use the highlight function now!If you’ve had yours for 8 years too, go for this as an upgrade! I also got given a lovely new case which fits perfectly and is so much nicer than my old tatty peeling leather one I had!!"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,What year or model is it?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 September 2020,"I ordered what I thought was the latest model Kindle Paperwhite form Amazon priced £129.99 and also an Omoton case for the 2019 onwards model.  The Paperwhite did not fit into the case. I tried four times to speak to Amazon and each time I was cut off (VERY RUDE). I tried to email them to find out if I had ordered the wrong case and which one to order or had I been sent an old model Paperwhite, but just kept going round in circles! I am now going to send them both back and start again. What a waste of my time and their money on postage costs.If the order is right it is good, if it is wrong you pull your hair out, SHOCKING CUSTOMER SERVICE!"
Mr. M. W. Dorling,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for reading in low light.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 September 2019,"Having resisted buying a Kindle for some years (I prefer a weighty tome to yet another device), I've found recently that reading by anything other than daylight or bright electric light (the latter of which I don't like) was becoming more difficult. Furthermore, I recently learned that Kindles do not emit blue light so are less likely to hinder sleep - something which also had concerned me for some years (I have the Kindle app on my phone but wouldn't use it for reading in bed, for that reason). Finally, all my bookshelves are now full, so I decided that maybe it was time to submit and purchase a Kindle. I am very pleased with the Paperwhite that arrived last week (and the cover that arrived at the same time) and would recommend one to anyone who is finding reading in anything less than bright light a problem, or who has run out of space for shelving books but not the wish to read them."
B H SLACK,5.0 out of 5 stars,so easy to use,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 July 2020,"My old Kindle which i have had for many years was acting up, needing to have a ""hard reboot"" twice so I decided to treat myself to a new one and keep the other as back-up (should I forget to charge the new one at some stage). What a difference, no more silly buttons on the side which I used to manage to knock frequently, nice simple touch screen.  I do still have a bit of an issue finding the books that I transferred over, but I think that is me rather than the Kindle.  The back light is brilliant, means I can finally read in bed comfortably. Very pleased with it."
Paula,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Multipurpose e-reader, but poor battery life",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2019,"Love this, especially as you can sync earphones for Audible audiobook listening. It’s my first e-reader with a light, which is great for evening reading. The screen is a little slow to respond to touch. However, I’m very disappointed by the battery life, but this is probably due to not being able to switch it off entirely. I’ve tried putting it in airplane mode and powering it down, but that doesn’t help. My old Kobo e-reader could be left switched off for a month and the battery percentage would still hold. It’s something I’ve just got to get used to."
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle paperwhite the flaws,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 May 2020,"This is my third kindle, and my second paperwhite. I love the backlight. The new o/s is a bit over the top on trying to upsell.The main gripe though is the position and operation of the on/off button. It is all too easy to touch this while holding kindle. I would prefer that you have to slide power off, as to accidentally do this would be almost impossible.Expensive for what it is, the battery is good, I would not buy another just to get better on/off button. if you read as often as I do this issue does come up a lot."
Mr Pricklepin,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is the Kindle to buy!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 April 2019,"This 8Gb model is the one I should have bought for myself, instead of the 32Gb version. It's the same apart from the storage, and the price! You can store thousands of books on 8Gb and if you're an Audible user hundreds of audio files as well. As everything is backed up on Amazon's Servers, why would you want to scroll through thousands of books on your device? OK if you're going on holiday where there's no WiFi or internet, but for every day use?This version has the smallest storage space for this model. It is more than adequate for your day to day reading needs. My older 4Gb Kindle never ran out of space and I have hundreds of documents and books stored on it. The only reason I upgraded was that the screen was better."
Lee W,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best gadget I never knew I needed!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 June 2019,"Firstly let me start by saying I have never been one for reading very much. I was hesitant on getting a kindle but as I prefer reading either at night or when I'm outside, the screen on the kindle paperwhite seemed the best option. I was not let down! the screen is brilliant, with varying brightnesses and zero issues with reading in direct sunlight.It can be slightly awkward to hold, I bought a flip case with mine which does make it easier, It's more like holding a book this way but with less weight.The User Interface and the system as a whole are not fantastic. It can be pretty slow at times and does not respond to light touch, you definitely have to be precise and patient with it.Overall, 100% worth it! I now use it every day and can often be found in a quiet corner somewhere reading a book now!"
linda dunstan,4.0 out of 5 stars,teething problems,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2019,I have an original Kindle which is working ok but I decided a back light would be beneficial. I was bought this for Christmas but am not finding it easy to use.Several issues with customer service including them hanging up on me.All my books were added to my new kindle however all the ones I had read were mixed with the ones I hadn't and the only way of sorting this is out is to do it manually which with around 400 books is going to take some time.The back light is great and the cover I bought enables the Kindle to turn on when I open the cover which is a nice feature. Hopefully I will get used  to my new Kindle and love it like my old one at present I am a little disappointed
Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Does the job very well,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 June 2020,"Very pleased with this. Designed for reading and does the job very well. I particularly like how you can adjust the font and font size to make reading even easier. Feels comfortable in your hand and not too heavy. You can even read in strong sunshine without glare. For me, the battery lasts about two weeks but keeping it on aeroplane mode extends it further. Sometimes when reading my finger accidentally presses the lock button but I found adding a cover helps, I bought the yellow fabric cover which looks great!"
David F,3.0 out of 5 stars,Way overpriced.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 April 2019,"Luckily I had a gift voucher for £50, and got this in the 'sale', so, it cost me £49.99, which I think is a fair price, no way would I have bought it at £119 or even £100. The item is fine. Amazon are just so greedy, hence the low score. And the battery life is an out and out lie, I have my light on 11, read for perhaps half an hour a night, turn it off completely and the battery loses 10 to 15% .Oh and the 'special offers. Wi fi is off so I only see the one thing."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,I hate it.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 June 2019,"It just makes me angry. I'm not throwing it to the bin just because it's a pressent from somebody I really appreciate. It's difficult to manage. Most options takes you to the amazon books shop, instead of to the library. It seems that is been designed to sell books instead of to read them. The screen is too small and the book pages don't addapt properly to the screen. If you make zoom you'll find you need to be moving the screen from side to side to be able to read each line. I'm really disappointed with it and I don't use it because it frustrates me. I regreat I didn't ask for a refound when I just got it instead of keeping it for sentimental reasons."
Steve,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 December 2019,"For something that's not particularly cheap either at £100, this Paperwhite kindle is a big disappointment.The software runs very clunky in how it responds to commands and touch when swiping to move the home screen or when reading a book in how the pages turn.So seeing how this was an early christmas present for my partner, I have to say, I would not recommend buying this version of a kindle, as a friend of mine has the older version and it's a lot better in every way.My subjective opinion of this gift is...Very Disappointing!!"
AJ Fernandez,2.0 out of 5 stars,I prefer the old one,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 May 2019,"I don't normally write reviews but I am quite annoyed with this kindle so I'm doing it.On the positive side the screen is much better, actually now that I need glasses to read I can see better with this screen.Apart from that I prefer the old one I don't thing Amazon improved the Kindle apart from the screen.The battery runs out very quickly and doesn't even tell you is running low, it just doesn't turn off whereas in the old one the device tells you the battery is low and you can still read for a couple of days after the message if you forget to charge it.In the old one you had to slide the button to turn it on, the new one it just pressing a button and it turns on in bag all the time.Finding my books is a nightmare and the touch screen is hideous as the screen is small and it's difficult to get what you want in some cases when you touch it.And something that's not improved is the time no need to hold the button to turn off the screen.Please next time improve it but without loosing the good features."
Memphis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Wonderful, my favourite gadget.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2019,"I bought this to replace my old kindle which I had dropped, and cracked the screen. I'm still not sure what the 'special features' are, but it is a wonderful little gadget if you read/listen to as many books as I do. Having arthritis in my wrists means I cannot hold a paperback for long, so propping this up on a flat surface means I can read to my heart's content. The only slightly off-putting feature is that it tells me how many other people have highlighted certain passages in whatever book I am reading. This irritates me; why should I need to know who else has highlighted what?  The audible function is easy to use and fantastic to have. I use it every day. And the 3-installment payment plan made it affordable."
Maidmarion,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth taking the plunge,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 October 2019,"Husband bought me another brand e-reader some years ago and I never took to it. Thought I liked to hold a ""real"" book, so was wary of taking the plunge into another e-reader. How glad I am that I did!Just the right size to hold comfortably; great if you're travelling to carry multiple books and keep the weight down; can still read it in a dim room or in sunlight; don't have to worry about bookshelf space anymore; no more trips to the library; great selection of free books with Amazon Prime reading. The icing on the cake was a good deal on the price on Amazon deal day (or whatever it's called). Really glad I made the purchase."
F. Gamble,5.0 out of 5 stars,As always terrific,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 January 2020,"This is my 6th Kindle (Yes I keep leaving them on airplanes and the like!) So easy to download all the existing content. Especially when you link it at the time of purchase. I purchaed through Amazon, so I don't know how easy that woudl be if you bought it in a shop.  Unlike my previous ones thsi has a back light which makes reading in bed at night so much easier.  My only issue with Kindles is that they are slippwery and smooth and so difficult to holdd. So I bought an Amazon leather cover which works much better, gives more traction."
Faye,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 May 2020,"I always said I would never go to electronic books but I've been converted.  I still love the smell of a book which will never change but I would not be without my kindle, it goes with me everywhere.  You can fit so many books on it, so if you are not feeling one, just try another.  You can fit it in your pocket so it can literally go with you wherever you go and if you get the chance to read there you are.  The battery life is amazing even with the light on.  I could not recommend high enough.  If you like reading, get yourself one."
Jon34,4.0 out of 5 stars,"A good, solid version of the kindle",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 January 2020,"This was a replacement for my first kindle that stopped working after over 8 years. The loss of the keypad makes it shorter than its predecessor but the screen is the same size which is welcome. Changing to the touch screen took a bit of time to adjust to as to go forward a page or going back involves touching the right or left side of the screen but ,almost everything else I use has a touch screen so, now I have got used to it, it is consistent with other devices. The slight problem is that other devices have precise ""keys"" on the screen to touch so it takes time to get used to the new layout, e.g. to get to the main menu you touch the top of the screen.For the wifi there is a flight mode, identical to smart phones etc., but it is unclear whether this switches off the wifi which I previously used to save power.I get a bit fed up with the suggestions for further reading but I suppose you have to let Amazon to advertise so that they can make more money, but I very rarely respond to advertising as I normally search in order to fulfill a need.I appreciate the internal light but I don't make much use of it as it is very unusual for me to read my kindle when lighting is not availableThe waterproofing is basically shower proof, but this is welcome when you are sitting on a beach.Overall, this is an appropriate replacement for my previous kindle,"
James,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent e-reader, attractive and feature-packed, but does lack library compatibility.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2018,"The Paperwhite is attractive, easy-to-use and has plenty of customisation option and note-taking ability - I use highlights a lot! Features such as wordwise and Vocabulary builder and interesting and well-thought out. Everything on the Paperwhite is easy to use.I do wish it would work with library e-books - renting e-books from my local library is something I find a lot more affordable than buying EVERY book, and other e-readers are compatible with library services whereas the Kindle is not.Also, as a more minor feature it could perhaps have an alternative highlight option for easier note categorisation - as the Paperwhite is greyscale it couldn't be another colour, but how about an outline option, or a squiggly underline? This"
Jean L,5.0 out of 5 stars,This paperwhite is waterproof,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 February 2020,"I have owned a kindle paperwhite for several years and decided to upgrade.  There are several new featured on my new paperwhite including returning a book straight to kindle unlimited as I remove it, and of course its waterproof so I can read by a pool without worrying.  it is also thinner & lighter, so overall i am very pleased with my new paperwhite."
Adam Ogle,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect travel companion for those who love to read,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 January 2019,"I've been deliberating about buying a kindle for a while as I love reading but I like the feel of an actual book but travelling more often pushed my hand! This has been the perfect travel companion, it's ideal for journeys as it fits in my pocket and weighs virtually nothing. The backlight is great for reading in pitch black and no glare at all in sunlight! I read for at least an hour every day and haven't charged it for almost a month now, the battery life is honestly incredible.My only negatives are that the screen on it doesn't feel completely flush all the way around and the power button is a little wonky - both of these haven't been picked up by any of my friends or family when they look at the device though so could be because I'm a little obsessive about that sort of thing (which is why I've still rated a 5)"
27-zetec,3.0 out of 5 stars,Watch you do get conned.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 December 2018,"I dislike being conned,like I was by your telephone representatives, as they said our conversation was recorded so you a have recorded. I spoke with your representatives concerning a fault with my original kindle paperwhite. It would not charge nor could switch it on, i tried all the recommendations to get it working without any success. At first your representatives said they would replace it, but they said I would have to buy one and because as they stated I was a good customer they would give me a good discount if I bought a new one. After I bought one with the discount I found out that you were giving a better discount on new a advert to sell kindle paperwhites, you conned me with false information and am not happy about it."
Hoolio,4.0 out of 5 stars,exceeded expectations,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 February 2019,I love this!I debated about an e-reader for years because I preferred real books but I'm so glad uve finally got one.it has allowed me to read and have access to a lot more books. what I love most is discovering small authors that are only on kindle.It has some great features.-light control let's me dim it down so I can read in bed withoutndisturbibg my partner-built in dictionary means I can easily and effortlessly look up words I don't understand-it's also great for reporting errors/typos etc in books you read-changing text size is super easy aswell- you can put a pin/password on it when locked to stop it from being as easily accessedconsalthough it's waterproof I find if I'm reading in the bath and the screen gets wet from condensation I can swipe easily when reading. this makes not having a button a real pain. getting a stylus helps but they are easily misplaced esp if you carry your book EVERYWHERE like meslow to load- the store is pretty slow to load. I tend to explore the store via an app on my phone and then sync my library upadverts- what I most hate about kindle and if anyone knows how to turn them off let me know . when the kindle goes into sleep mode adverts pop up. often it's books and I really dnt like that because anyone can see it and Its not always a good representation if what I'm reading.
Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Rubbish,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2021,Do not buy this kindle it is absolutely rubbish.  I have to charge it every 3 days and have to reboot it often. This is my second one of this model as the first one was even worse and Amozon replaced it with this one. I will struggle on with this one as to much trouble to send back due to covid. I only use to read on an evening so not sitting reading all day.
Paul Mc Carthy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 May 2020,I have to give credit to Amazon about this product that I ordered and it was delivered very fast - My initial concern was the Kindle was a little too small for me - I need a larger screen. Amazon Kindly refunded my money and I am looking at the larger Kindle device - great service and confidence when buying
ISV,4.0 out of 5 stars,Quite Good,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2019,"There are a few additional features compared with the original basic model. Athough there are advantages in this, these features, the back light in particular, do affect the battery life. I have had to turn down the light to almost zero to conserve battery. I do miss the LIST of books which appeared on my old version. Now instead the picture of the front cover and the Collections options are proving difficult to manage. One great miss is to enable me to click to turn a page from BOTH sides of the display and the touch screen facility for this is hypersensitive as is other touch screen operations which result in inadvertently moving to screens which I did not request. I will get used to the model in time but I'm fairly happy at the moment."
Phil D,3.0 out of 5 stars,All good except...ads and screensaver,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2020,"I love the screen and accessing all my books, I don't regret purchasing it and the niggles I have just need an update from amazon.Given amazon tracks all my purchases both on kindle, my book purchases and audible, you'd have thought the ads would be appropriate (see pics) - I read theology, apologetics, non-fiction on race, class and culture and some action, thriller - the ads definitely don't connect. And there are ads everywhere except when I'm in a book.The other annoyance is that I've seen older kindles with tidy screensavers of book covers on the kindle or at the very least being able to choose some select images. This wouldn't take much from the amazon team to sort.Finally as I can't share from Good reads to twitter from a kindle, remove the image and tickbox that teases every time I click share!"
R. Markham,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good purchase,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 September 2019,"Somewhat hesitant about getting a Kindle as I have been happy reading ebooks on my iPad. However I finally relented and bought the Paperwhite to take on holiday to cut down hard book space/weight. What a good decision that was! Using the Kindle on the beach was so much better than wrestling with a book, trying to keep it dry, pages falling out, book getting wet etc. It is well constructed, very light, waterproof, compact and really easy to hold or prop up at any angle for easy reading positions on the beach. I have installed the Kindle App on my iPhone and iPad as the Kindle syncs with both of them (as well as iMac at home) so I have the best of all worlds. The front light facility is really useful in poorly lit environments. I purchased it over two weeks ago and whilst I have used it regularly every day it still has 30% charge left. To protect the Kindle, an outer cover is a worthwhile purchase. I have no regrets about purchasing the Kindle Paperwhite and am very pleased with the purchase."
Irene,3.0 out of 5 stars,not happy,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 May 2019,"I have had various kindle paperwhites over the years and can only say that with each new version the performance suffers , since they keep updating (every few weeks its seems) I have problems, since the last update with the filter I can no longer download a book without having to restart the darn thing, and that's even when fully charged. I still say that in my opinion the best kindle was the old keyboard version that was very reliable, why you have to keep doing software updates is beyond me as is putting on goodreads that is something I never use all I want is an ereader that works but unfortunately this new version is not it"
Ms. K. M. Borg,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just as described,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2019,"This is my second Kindle.  The first one is 8 years old, so this is bright, light and smaller than my other one.  It took a bit of registering due to a misunderstanding about Goodreads.  However, I called the help desk at Amazon, they are brilliant and helped me sort the problem out.  I am not sure all my books have downloaded, I had 195, but I will have to check that.  The kindle itself is easy to use, light to hold and I absolutely love it.  It is much brighter than my previous one too."
Wee Nell,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beware of misleading “Special Offers”,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2020,"This Kindle was purchased as a Xmas gift and only after reading another reviews post-purchase did I discover what ”With/Without special offers” actually means.  It means advertising. I can find nothing on the product description that explains this. My assumption was that the additional available for purchase (case, charging unit) were special offers. As I did not want to give a gift with Annoying adverts, I called customer services and they said they could remove the “special offers” without having to return the device but I would have to pay for this. I paid the £10 requested and if you don’t want adverts on your device, make sure you select “withou special offers”!"
Chris Naish,3.0 out of 5 stars,OK but not my favorite purchase,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 May 2020,"I guess I still like the feel of a book.  I can see that when I travel the Kindle will have its advantages.  The screen is good in a wide range of lighting conditions and the device feels itself good in the hand although I'd prefer it a little taller and narrower (more paperback book format).  The device seems to have a slow response to me based on early experience.  Personally, if you aren't going to travel much certainly do not get a case - I would agree with many of the bad reviews of the standard 'leather' (is it really - not any leather I've had before) case - I've taken my case off the device - when its on it make the device too heavy and it has quite hard edges - it doesn't feel good in the hand.  Whatever its made of it shouts plastic!  The charger is OK and the device seems to hold a charge for a suitably long time.  I have been using the kindle app on the phone and I'm not convinced this is a significant advantage (I miss seeing the covers etc in colour when selecting books).  I may update this as I grow into it."
Beckside Girl,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like this Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 August 2019,This Kindle replaced one that I have had for many years - I like the size of it and the screen and operation are very good.  The only thing I miss is being able to turn the pages on either side of the Kindle - this one can only be changed by touching the right hand side of th screen -  I lie on my right hand side in bed to read and find it awkward to use - I suppose it is after years of turning the pages by clicking with my left thumb!It was straightforward to set up and all my books transferred over without problems.  I bought it when it was on offer - I am not sure I would have bought it if not - there are quite a few e readers on offer.
Hants,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 March 2019,"I bought this Kindle Paper White to replace my last Kindle which I loved. I thought my last Kindle was perfect until I got this one; it really is brilliant. It does exactly what it says it does and I love reading from it. I have set it up exactly as I want it, which makes reading easy and a pleasure.My old Kindle was slightly bigger so I had to add some packing to the case (see the photo) which works just as well - it shuts off and wakes up when the lid is opened and shut. The whole thing is very portable and easily fits in a pocket, not like my iPad.The back lighting makes this Kindle even better.I have not tested the waterproof angle as I don't read in the bath - I prefer a shower!"
MrsB,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is a beautiful thing.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2020,This is my second Kindle Paperwhite. I had the previous one for a long time and loved it but unfortunately I dropped it in the bath! It survived but there were small signs that it may not have enjoyed the bath as much as I did. I was bought this waterproof Kindle Paperwhite as a gift in case the other one failed (and in case I dropped this one in the bath too). It is slightly smaller than the original and I would guess that it may be a little lighter. I love it too. Life without a Kindle Paperwhite would be very difficult.
Charlie D.,1.0 out of 5 stars,Early adopters usually get punished...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 December 2018,"I have an old kindle and decided to upgrade to the new paperwhite. Within three weeks of light use, the text is already fading away diagonally, a hardware error previously found in old paperwhites. Instead of offering me an exchange for a new unit, Amazon asked me to call kindle support or engage in a chat, despite having clearly explained the issue and all pointing to a hardware problem. Last time I had an issue and tried the chat, I spent literally an hour and urgung the person at the otger side to please read what I was writting. Very dissapointed with the quality, as there is a more natural reading feel in the old paperwhite. I have now requested a refund and will buy once there is a review of the hardware, and in a different store such as John Lewis, who offer better support. Early adopters usually get punished..."
A. R. Cooper,4.0 out of 5 stars,Battery Life Issue Solved,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2020,"I’ll get straight to the point. If your Kindle is suffering from poor battery life and if you have downloaded a lot of books to it, it may be that it has got stuck indexing. You could try this, it worked for me:1 Search for a nonsense word such as “gyrddtf”.2 If “Text in Books” is highlighted, tap it, and it will list books that are not yet indexed.3 When I did this there was one book listed. I deleted it (removed from device).That’s it.Since doing this my kindle has drained from 100% to 85% in three days of normal use (with wifi on and the light set to 12), which seems acceptable. I have also re-downloaded the offending book and it indexed without any issue.There’s plenty on-line regarding this issue (when you realise what it is) but essentially it seems to be an issue with the Kindle trying to index a large numbers of books. This is a fairly processor intensive process and sometimes the Kindle simply gets stuck. It will keep trying to index thus draining the battery quickly. Switching to airplane mode or turning off wifi will have no effect too, as the process is internal. My Kindle initially lost 60% battery in the first day after downloading 170 books!The issue will mostly effect those who already own Kindles and therefore have built up a library of books and try to download them to their new devices. Users of earlier non-backlit versions will also be used to normally excellent battery life. All of which compounds the frustration.In my experience Kindle products are usually of very good quality. It’s a shame that the physical technology is let down by an apparent software glitch.Hope this helps."
maxine jesney,1.0 out of 5 stars,Bad battery,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 October 2020,I have a kindle voyage that I have had for a couple of years now and the memory is too small so I thought I would upgrade to the new paperwhite big mistake. While downloading all the books that I have I noticed that the battery does not last very long. I downloaded about 50 when I noticed that the battery had gone down from about 95% to 45% in a matter of hours I then left it to go to bed and checked it the next morning and it was flat and I had to charge it again. So that is the reason for my 1 star.
Miss Williams,4.0 out of 5 stars,ease of holding while reading.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2020,Clear reading.Good weight.Good shaped screen.I wanted to be able to get Audible and whispersynct but it stated I had to perchase other items to do this.This was not made clear in the description that convinced me to buy it.I am very dissapointed and can only use it like the older version Kindle.I now have to go back and use my Lenovo Yoga 3 tablet if I want to listen to the book I am reading.Very unfair instruction on the description.
Worldabove,5.0 out of 5 stars,To date-all good!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 October 2019,"To date I think the Kindle is very good value for the price. Takes a bit of time to get used to it and I am still learning.I already had a couple of good headphones which are now paired with the device for a choice of enjoying a book read, or normal reading. They both work fine. I have purchased a couple of books to my taste, rather than having the free ones, including an audio book to try; At this time I want to remain free of added contracts.To date I am content with the purchase and Amazon went to a lot of trouble to get it quickly to me from Germany."
Luann Cross,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 January 2019,"I thought this would be the ideal replacement for my last 2 kindles.  It is lightweight, which is great.  But too wide for my hands, I can't find a comfortable way to hold it.  To turn it on you have to push a black little button at the bottom which is hard to find in the dark.  The page turning is very slow compared even to the original kindle.  Not really what I expected at all.  Plus - to protect my kindle white the prices of the covers are ridiculously expensive.  I have to say I haven't really warmed to this device at all.  The lighting is good, but again it is not easy to turn up or down the brightness without going through unnecessary steps.  Sorry, Amazon but it could be better."
The Camera Guy,5.0 out of 5 stars,I am enjoying this unit.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 June 2020,"I love how small and easy to hold this item is, the search result are responsive and although it is different to a normal pad, the experience is not that bad, book reading is excellent and comfortable on the eyes, you can adjust the size of the font and the backlight is great and adjustable. Really enjoying this product I have never used one before and not regretting purchasing it, amazon offered terms and spread the payments over 5-6 months which helped, why not.. the unit only comes with a cable and instructions, so will need a proper fast charger."
Beany,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor replacement,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2020,"Bought this to replace my 2011 Paperwhite, I'm now waiting for my 3rd replacement, the battery is very poor my old one I charged every 4-6 the new one the batter barely lasts a few days (not high usage) only bedtime reading.  Received a replacement which took 4 week and the battery is the same spent 3 hours on chat trying to resolve this to no avail mainly because 30 days had elapsed since buying due to the time it took to replace.  I ended up being passed between 4 operators.  They refused to give me Amazon complaints contact details, I ended up getting a call back from Amazon the upshot is a 3rd Kindle will be delivered tomorrow I initiated the call at 9:33am and a not great resolution was reached by 1:50pm really poor customer services.  I'm hoping the 3rd one will be better but I don't think it will, love my old Kindle no problems, good battery lasted 9 years, the updated version is very poor in comparison feel that it has gone back not forward technically, if you're old Kindle still works don't upgrade"
SkodaMike,3.0 out of 5 stars,Amazon need to do better with support and instruction documents,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 November 2018,"This Kindle arrived with close to zero instructions. The statement that there is help on board is useless if, like happened to my wife, happens to another unsuspecting customer. In removing the packaging the device became turned on. Un-be knowing to us the touch screen was active and the language selected was Chinese. Have Amazon tried this product on western language based customers with the device set to Chinese and asked them to change the language? Luckily we have a Chinese speaking neighbour in the area or it would have been sent back. ACTION: Amazon review your testing procedures and improve delivery key security or provide better documentation. Incidently - there is diddly squat info on the website for this product."
Lizzi M,4.0 out of 5 stars,Probably the best yet,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2019,"Purchased the new (10th generation) kindle paperwhite to replace my 8yr old existing kindle which had served me well. This was mainly for the convenience of the light and touchscreen. I had read the excellent  reviews and bought for the reduced price whilst it was on offer. I am really pleased I talked myself into the purchase!I was wary of having problems transferring my existing library to the new kindle but the instructions were simple and it couldn't have been easier.It looks and feels so much sleeker although the size & weight difference is hardly noticeable. It did not take long to get used to the new layout although I do sometimes change pages without intending to! Having the adjustable light screen is so much better, I don't know how I managed without one for so long.A great purchase and would recommend to anyone considering an e-reader."
Gerard Murphy,5.0 out of 5 stars,So light and easy to use.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 August 2020,I just love my new Kindle. I always thought I never wanted one. However I’m going on holiday and don’t want to take a pile of books.Kindle is sl light and compact and thin.  It tells you the page you are on and the percentage of the book you have left. Plus how many minutes until the end of the chapter.You can read easily in bright light or darkness. Touch the right of the page and the next turns. Touch the left side to go back. Thousands of books are free on Amazon to download. I’m delighted with it.
Sandra Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is my third Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 September 2020,"I bought my first Kindle when they first came out. My second one has over 400 books on it I decided to buy a third  and leave my 400 books on my second kindle,  it would have to be a big bookcase to store all of these. When I want a new book to read on holiday or on a train I just down load a sample to see if I like the Author and in minuets its ready to read. I would recommend the kindle to all."
Mop,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Improvement on previous Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 June 2019,"I use the kindle mainly for holidays when it is so much more practical, but after a 3 week holiday using my (very) old basic edition, when it was getting quite difficult to manually 'turn' the pages, I sent for this one.  What bliss !!  So much easier to use, only slight quibble is that the touch screen sometimes has a mind of its own, but the old turn it off and on again always solves the problem.  It is lovely to see the pictures of the covers of the books in my library, makes them a lot more memorable.  Definitely changed my previous view that I much prefer a book to a kindle.  Think the Kindle comes out on top now."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very disappointed!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2018,"Unfortunately, my old Kindle paperwhite developed a small crack on the screen, allowing the back-light to seep through so I reluctantly decided to replace it. I was unable to replace it with the same model as the 10th gen has been released but it promised a better display and other benefits.As promised, the 10th generation paperwhite is lighter but ever so slightly smaller (meaning my previous case is now too big). The screen also seems smoother and less 'grainy' to touch.Unfortunately though, the screen colour appears less like a book and has more of a 'fake' light. Additionally, upon turning pages, there seems to be a shadow from the previous page- especially on the home screen, library and in the store. At times, the reaction speed from touch to page turn etc seems very delayed whereas at others it is too responsive. Finally, unlike previously, I purchased the Kindle with offers as I like to see recommended books etc, but this too is very annoying. It is not as simple as 'swipe to unlock' but will often take you to the offer, whether you want to or not.In all, I am very disappointed with the 10th generation Kindle to the point where I am considering putting it back in the box and using my old one."
Ms. Wk Kelsall,4.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive for what it is and I do not know what the special offers are??,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 September 2019,"Not being technologically inclined I had to have help sorting it out initially. I purchased this Kindle because at present I have an eye problem and really fancied someone reading to me! I am now ok with it and the headphones I purchased to go with it. One thing does bother me and that is the small amount of audible books there seems to be and the fact that it is not made immediately obvious which books are audible, unless I am missing something? Now I have bought a cover that states it is for all new Kindles (2019) and it is too small!!Don't think I would buy one again."

Marco Antonio Zanchini,5.0 out of 5 stars,Smaller than previous version I had,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2020,"Lighter, smaller, battery lasts longer. My wife got it for me for Christmas. Wasn't expecting it at all and it was an amazing surprise. Back light is very useful if you want to read at night. Apparently you can't switch it off during the day, but have to check better. Reloading of all my books has been extremely easy and quick. Some books are kept in the cloud and if I want to re-read one wi-fi connection for download is necessary, but it isn't a problem. Only check before boarding a long flight what you want to re-read. Nice tool for somebody like me always on a plane."
Wrennables,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, but kids can't use the audiobook feature",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 May 2019,"Generally very happy with this. I bought it for my son. I have the older paperwhite and love it, and since this one also does audiobooks (via bluetooth headset) I thought it would be perfect for my son. I was a bit disappointed though to find that the audiobook feature doesn't work if you have parental controls on. I didn't expect this as there is no problem using audiobooks alongside parental controls on a Fire Tablet. I'd rather not have my son using a tablet in bed so I've just had to leave the parental controls off. It's disappointing that this wasn't stated in the description, but I'd still have bought it if I'd known.Audiobooks drain the battery a bit, as you might expect, but it still does several evenings of audiobooks off a single charge. And if you're just using it for reading then it lasts for ages.I use it with the light set really low - around 3 or 4 on the scale. It's plenty bright enough in the dark, and the light isn't necessary when it's not dark around, so I'm not sure why they recommend the brighter settings.Kid mode (parental control) is handy if you're not bothered about the audiobooks - you can set up a child's profile and choose which books in your library they can access."

Matt852,4.0 out of 5 stars,A small step backwards on my last Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 December 2020,"I have been using kindle for years and this kindle does the job in the same way as all the others and the reading experience is great.For the first time however this kindle doesn’t feel like an improvement on my previous kindle voyager. The two issues are:1 the battery life seems to be worse than before, specifically I have resorted to turning airplane mode on most of the time and only turning on wifi when I’m expecting a book to be downloaded. If left on I’m definitely getting only days use rather than the weeks use I used to enjoy on the voyager.2: A second niggle is the power button. On the voyager it was on the back and recessed, it was impossible to accidentally power the device off. On the new device is on the bottom and when I hold the device whilst reading occasionally I knock the button and turn off the device. It doesn’t happen all the time just occasionally but it’s annoying that Amazon have taken this retrograde step.Apart from this I love  the device."
Athena53,5.0 out of 5 stars,Light and easy to use,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 August 2020,"This is my third Kindle and as time goes on the improvements make the reading experience better. The first one's screen was damaged when I stood on it, and the second accidently got into the washing machine! (It did dry out and continue to work but a bit sluggishly). So I was delighted to find my new one is waterproof! Downloading into my downloads took a while as I have 400+ books on it, but we're there now. I also like the instant wake-up with the new cover."
Rich,4.0 out of 5 stars,Reading more than ever....,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 July 2019,"This is my first ever kindle so I don’t really have anything to measure it against. I’d been speaking to a friend about how I liked to read etc but sometimes when going away I had to decide which books to take with me as too many took up too much weight & room. He recommended a kindle.I was unsure. I like the feel of a book & silly as it sounds, the smell! I like to hold a book and know I’m reading it.I took the plunge on prime day to follow his recommendation.First thought, crikey that’s light!Charged it up, powered on & signed into my amazon.First thing that I really noticed was the screen flicker when I swiped on the screen. It felt like I was using a really old tablet which didn’t have the memory capacity to keep up with me swiping. I now understand I was wrongly comparing it to the use of a tablet when this is what it is, a portable book reader & storage.Signed up to free trial of kindle unlimited and started reading. Since then I haven’t really put it down. I’d say I’m reading more than I was before and it’s so easy on the eyes when reading in bed without the light on.My initial reservations were guided by a false expectation after being used to swiping and reading stuff on my Samsung Tablet. This is a far better reading experience than trying to read a book through the kindle app on the tablet though.If you understand it’s use and what it’s for then you will come to enjoy using it. I am still within the period where I can send it back if I wish but I wouldn’t be without it now so it’s here to stay."
Jill Dunne,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t like the adverts,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 August 2019,"This is my third kindle and I asked my husband for the waterproof one for my birthday. On the whole it is great, a lot lighter to hold and more responsive. It said it holds a charge for longer but I seem to be charging it once a week. I think this may have something to do with the adverts they post when on screensaver. I find the adverts really annoying and it takes longer to wake up and you have to swipe the screen to read instead of it going straight to your page. So overall it is okay and other than it being waterproof not much has changed. I would really like to be able to get rid of he adverts."
Karo Son,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth upgrading unless you have specific reasons,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 December 2018,"--I bought it as it was advertised as slimmer and lighter; AND you can listen to audio books.Much to my surprise it certainly doesn't feel lighter or slimmer.That was annoying enough. Amazon think we're all daft, I suppose.Now, as for the audio book, oddly enough you can't read and listen to an audio book. I realise not a lot of people read and listen at same time. I do that because I'm a logophile. But also millions of people learn English around the world.How difficult was this tiny software change to make something a lot more useful?!"
Dante Fantinel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 April 2020,"Never had a kindle before and it definitely changed my life!Amazing product, would definitely suggest to all those readers that take public transports or have long commutes to work.. Definitely easier to carry this than a heavy 500pages book!Light doesn't bother your eyes, even after hrs of reading, and can be regulated easily.Chose it because it was also waterproof and it didn't let me down!! When my water bottle opened in my backpack I juste wiped it up and it was ready to go!Only thing I didn't like is the on/off button on the bottom of the kindle, exactly where it tend to hold it, so it happened more than once that I mistakenly turned it off while I was reading"

cjmp.41,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle Paperwhite What a disappointment,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 June 2019,"I have purchased 7 versions of Kindle and decided to purchase the latest version as better battery life etc.WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Fully charged Kindle, used on and off over  3 days say for about 1 hour at a time and within 36 hours battery was down to 50%. By mid day on 3rd day battery down to zero.. What is this about battery now lasts weeks not hours.Also colour is not white, but verging on cream. The screen is not as white as on my existing version which I have had for 2 years. Not as easy to read as previous version.Still  no facility for those who like to hold in left hand. Need to use both hands to change page. Hold in right hand and only small movement of thumb changes page. Earlier versions had facility to hold in ether hand.I feel I have wasted £119.Not something I would recommend."
J. Prowse,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 December 2019,"I was really looking forward to receiving my kindle paperwhite. Unfortunately, it hasn't lived up to my expectations and I wish I had spent the money on an Amazon fire tablet instead. The battery doesn't hold its charge as advertised, possibly because it keeps switching itself on. I frequently go to pick it up from where I left it switched off, to find it on and displaying one of the book advertisements. The longest I have managed without recharging is 48 hours. When it comes to switching it off 9 times out of 10 it flicks to an advert instead of giving me the option to switch off, so I have to swipe back in and try again. Simple enough but frustrating. I find the library list a bit cumbersome to use, there must be a slicker way to display the books. My biggest problem with it however, is that it doesn't display magazines properly, making them near impossible to read and enjoy. So, I end up having to take my old tablet out with me in case I want to read a magazine. Altogether a bit disappointing."
K. A. Earley,5.0 out of 5 stars,You can read this kindle without a room light on.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2019,"I love my new kindle paperwhite. I always loved my kindle keyboard but the paperwhite suits me better now. I can read with the backlight without disturbing my husband. Also, its waterproof, so I am relaxed reading around the pool on holiday. I like that you can easily alter the size of the font and the touch screen is great as I'm so used to touch screens (iPads and phones etc). Its so light and easy to turn pages. Also , I registered it to the same account as my old kindle and everything transferred over effortlessly."
Edward W,2.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as I had hoped,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2020,"Hoped e-ink would be superior to a tablet but it's really not. It's easier on the eyes, but terrible black contrast makes mangas and comics appear faded, with blacks all just a mushy grey.Interface is slow and frustrating, and the battery life isn't that great as it drains when you are not using it so you can't just leave it sat there for a few weeks and expect it to power up.If you have a nice tablet, I really can't recommend a kindle."
L. Dean,5.0 out of 5 stars,a great kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 August 2020,"This is my third kindle and its so much better than I have had before. The touchscreen is so much more responsive and reading is much easier on the eyes. I was glad to pay the extra £10 to get no special offers which is only advertising and a months free trial of Prime. When you set it up, you cannot continue without the Prime trial, which I found annoying. I had to go onto my account to stop it from rolling over. Other than that, its a great piece if kit."

repj,3.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle e-reader paperwhite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2019,"Good for reading e-books with bigger screen and better battery life than my android phone that I used previously with the kindle app. Had hoped to read newspapers on the paperwhite as well but have to purchase these from Amazon, we already have a newspaper subscription but have found that you can't download this app or log-in online using the kindle which is a great shame, don't want to pay for papers twice! Using the internet is possible but inferior as the display is tiny and doesn't utilise the e-ink technology so isn't as sharp."
Val,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2020,"I recently bought a Kindle paper white, having had a kindle fire for several years. I am really disappointed with it. I find the brightness very 'white' or dim, depending on how bright it is turned to.I haven't used it in the sunshine yet, so maybe I will change my mind on that.I thought I would be able to use the internet easily as with the kindle fire, but it's a right fight on to get onto the internet with the paper white. Not easy to use at all.Basically it is only any good for reading in the sunshine, so it has been put away for using on holiday."
Jeff Granger,4.0 out of 5 stars,It's OK but nothing special,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 April 2019,"This is my first e-reader. It works. It's like a computer from the 1980s. The page changes aren't especially crisp. Thought it might have a page-change animation, but no. It's easy to accidentally change a page. I like the link to Wikipedia for words that need explaining. It's easy to buy books from Amazon but not so easy to work out how to get the free ones each month they advertise. First battery charge has lasted a couple of weeks now (at 50%). It works, but there's nothing about it to make you smile."
kiwidude,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great - except for the power switch placement,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2019,"Long term fan of the Kindle series - previously owned a Kindle Keyboard and Kindle Voyage (best model ever, sad it was discontinued). However while the Paperwhite has some improvements (white on black for reading is phenomenal to reduce eye strain, particularly at night but I use it all the time) there are definitely some steps backwards like slightly lower quality of readability without the glass screen of the Voyage.Whoever designed this Paperwhite model physical layout needs to be kicked. The power switch is a protruding button located at the *bottom* of the device. Which means for anyone holding the kindle in their left hand using their pinkie finger to rest the base of the kindle on, you are constantly in danger of accidentally turning it off. Or at best dealing with an uncomfortable switch against your skin. In addition if you decide to prop your kindle up vertically against something (e.g. while reading at lunch), the button will all too simply switch your Kindle off as you place it on your desk. What the hell were Amazon thinking??? Put the damn button at the top of the device out of the way where it belongs like previous Kindle models had and most phones have done...Most other features of the Paperwhite in terms of day to day use for reading are excellent. While I love the ""white on black"" mode, it does take 7 touches on the screen to toggle this reading mode hence I leave it on this all the time. Please sort out your firmware Amazon, make this a simple first class setting like changing fonts and sizes are! I also miss the page turn buttons of the Voyage when it comes to navigating through the list of books or moving past a hyperlinked tbale of contents page - sometimes there are not many places left on the screen where you can safely touch/swipe. Far too many times I have accidentally opened the wrong book or leaped far into a book from a contents hyperlink when just wanting to get to the next page.All that said my Paperwhite goes everywhere with me (as did all Kindles I had before now) to let me read anywhere and on the go as it fits comfortably enough in a pocket. The latest Oasis model is tempting - physical buttons would remove one of my gripes. However it is also a larger size which may no longer fit in most pockets which would be a dealbreaker alone. Obviously more expensive and is heavier to hold in the hand. Since I prefer to read holding the Kindle in my left hand I also have some fears about the power button location on the Oasis too. The way they managed to place it on the Voyage was brilliant..."
Rohit Gogna,4.0 out of 5 stars,I've started reading a lot more,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2020,"I have an iPad mini - so I was hesitant in making this purchase.  However, it's a different experience reading on a kindle.  It's lighter and specifically made for one job, so has no distractions.  It doesn't feel you are reading on a computer screen which it does with the iPad mini (and this is coming from an Apple fanboy).  I brought the no special offers version as I don't want adverts.I've voted it to 4 stars overall for this reason.  As it feels like a cheeky tactic from Amazon.  However the product it self is 5 star.  Don't hesitate, see it as something that will help you learn."
Spot Check,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy on the eye and handy size.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 December 2019,"I bought this as an upgrade to my 'standard' Kindle, which was a few years old and had stopped being able to find the internet (and so was useless).  My new one is very easy to use, the touchscreen navigation is intuitive, and it is easy to hold and read.  My only surprise was that books do not automatically fully download straight away.  You get a thumbnail only initially.  You then have to download from there.  This isn't a problem once you know it, but it's important to know if you wanted to start reading when remote from the internet.  Overall, I expect to use this much more than my previous one, and Kindle will be first choice for all my reading matter in the future."
Valentino,4.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive but great for travelling,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 April 2020,"Ideal for travelling. Has adjustable background light, useful for me as I sometimes read in the dark. It’s very lightweight. I do recommend buying a leather cover for it. The big let down is the touch screen. It sometimes skips 5 or 10 pages when you try to turn the page and it’s a nightmare getting back to where you left off. Would have liked a slightly bigger screen. It is expensive for what it is but as I am an avid reader, money well spent."
ga sue,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lots to learn!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 October 2020,Nice to hold but a lot to learn.  I had the Kindle App on my ipad for a number of years and found this easier for nstance to click in the book mark and remove the book mark.  Good that there is a book included on how to use the Kindle paperwhite but I read about keeping Collections and haven't fathomed that out yet.  Have yet to order and download a new book...that should be interesting.  Having said all that it is nice and light and easy to read.

It’s light, easy to use , love the fact no buttons on the side to turn a page just swipe."
Bigbaddom,4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect but it switches itself off too easily.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 February 2020,"Everything good about the Paperwhite has already be written and I would agree with all, good lighting, good battery, etc... however one design fault prevents me for giving it five stars: when holding it with one hand in an L shape position, you can very often switch it off involuntary. Not the end of the world in the scheme of things but Amazon could and should do better.Allegedly there is new Kindle Pw coming in 2021, I hope the designers will move this button away from where it is located at the moment.  How about at the top on the right ?"
Family of Four,5.0 out of 5 stars,"If you are wavering, just go for it as you probably will not be disappointed.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 November 2019,"Perfect for the avid reader.

In the end I succumbed and bought whilst on offer  to save lugging several books away on a holiday and now regret putting my purchase off for so long.Have to save the advert on the screen saver doesn’t bother me - certainly not enough to splash out £10 to remove it.Enjoying both the written word and audible books too.If you are undecided and are wavering, I would say just go for it.Incidentally I splashed out and treated myself to the twilight blue Amazon leather case too and they look beautiful together.

K Mussell,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been converted!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 July 2020,"With libraries being closed due to lockdown, I reluctantly dug out my very old Kindle.  Having downloaded a few books and started to get used to an e-reader again I spoke with a few friends who highly recommended the updated Paperwhite.  I love it!  Very quick to open from standby mode, easy to use, and a comfortable size and weight in my small hands.  I love that it is waterproof and that it has a dark mode (very handy for nights plagued by insomnia), and would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone, especially with the added benefits of Audible integration (and all the features which come with a Prime account if you have one).  I will always truly love real paper books, but for convenience and ease of use the Paperwhite is hard to beat."
klw,5.0 out of 5 stars,Much improved version.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 May 2019,"Compared to the original Kindle, which I have been using happily for several years, the new one is much lighter and more compact, easier to carry around and use and with a greatly extended battery life. The only area which is less than totally satisfactory is the touch screen, which does not always respond immediately. In some ways, the older method of changing pages by pressing a button on the side of the Kindle was easier, quicker and more intuitive. However, I have been very satisfied with the old one and I am sure I shall be equally satisfied with the new one, so I am giving it five stars."

Wanted the built in light which works really well, however, it seems to have lost some of the features I really relied on on my old kindle such as synchronising between the kindle app on my iPad and the kindle itself so I could swap between them seamlessly.  Also seems to lose the book I’m currently on when I browse elsewhere.  When I’m reading it’s easy to manage but as yet, I’m not entirely happy with the functions"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the very best.....,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 August 2019,"I have been putting of buying a kindle for years now. However I finally decided to take the plunge with the kindle paperwhite because A) it was amazon prime day, so it was much cheaper than usual and B) because it’s waterproof - I’ve no idea why that mattered to me but it was a cool selling point above the others types of ebook reader.When it arrived I immediately went to work adding it to Wifi and downloading a few books. I discovered I could read my kindle in daylight, direct sunlight and in a pitch black room as well as (and this part really is amazing) I could resize the txt and change the font! This meant I could read my kindle without my glasses.... because of this, I’ve managed to read several books since it arrived and In fact I’ve read more books this last month than I have in the last 10 years due to not having to struggle to read the text anymore. I’ve kindle really is one of the very best things I’ve ever purchased."
Readers Together,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic. Best Kindle yet.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 October 2019,"This is by far the best Kindle I've ever had. I love the storage capacity. I love that it's waterproof so don't have to worry about it getting wet at the side of the pool, or if accidentally dropped in the bath. It's so easy to use and responses to touch well. Having the audio aspect is amazing, I love that I can listen to my audiobooks via the Kindle now, the only downside is that there isn't a headphone jack so you need to use Bluetooth headphones - which of course, is why it's waterproof - it would be nice if there was an option."
shawn green,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best invention since the light bulb......?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 July 2020,".....ok, might be pushing it a little, however, this is immense.

Back light is about perfect, is adjustable and is easy on the eye. Battery life is just ridiculously good, it feels amazing and comfortable in the hand. It has a good weight (as did the gen1) and feels solid. Its had a good spray from the shower when i left it on the side, a quick wipe and its good to go. As always, the kindle store is amazingly easy to use and navigate, and downloads are almost instant.Could this be improved? Nope, as a stand alone reader (which is all i want it for) its perfect. I did consider getting the Kindle fire, but didnt want the distraction of surfing the web.As a tip, grab the authentic kindle paper white waterproof case. The cheaper ones look and fit great, but even after 2 weeks looked a little worn, and aren't splash proof, as after wiping they stay damp."
CatW,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great update if you love Audible!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 July 2019,"I've had an older kindle paperwhite for years and it is still going strong, so I hadn't contemplated changing it until I saw this edition included audible.I love audible books and was previously listening on my smartphone in the app. However, having both the book and the audible copy downloaded on the new kindle means that they sync with each other whenever I need to swap to headphones and back so I never lose my position. The only issue is that the audible files take a few minutes to download to the kindle due to their size.I do miss the beveled screen as I found it easier to grip, and I find this screen seems to get more greasy finger marks more easily, but overall I'm very happy with it."

Darren Hucker,5.0 out of 5 stars,Freedom,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 August 2020,After lots of doubts of changing the habit of reading a good book on paper and the feel of turning the pages and where you are in the story I can’t believe the freedom the kindle offers. No heavy books to carry around. No panic of how many books I take with me on holiday and the anxiety of pacing my reading to ensure I don’t finish them too quick. Had it 2 weeks and read 2 big books already. No need to worry about lighting great to read before bed with lights out. No misplaced bookmarks and % count to know how far your through and only needed a minimal charge in 2 weeks. Plus the saving of ebooks will eventually pay for itself and no cluttering of books around your house. Wish I bought it years ago.

Carol,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy to recommend the Paperwhite!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 March 2019,"Really glad I bought it!  Small enough to take anywhere, backlight is easily adjusted, and turned off when light not required .the battery does last really well, obviously it depends how much it’s used,but it charges quickly too. I bought a cover for it whichworks well.  It was easily set up too.I’ve struggled a little with  some things particularly searching the library, I wish the books appeared a little clearer ( in colour would be even better!) as I tend to remember books by their covers.  I’m sure I’ll work out where I’m going wrong eventually! Overall I am really pleased with my choice and would recommend it."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of the very best.....,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 August 2019,"I have been putting of buying a kindle for years now. However I finally decided to take the plunge with the kindle paperwhite because A) it was amazon prime day, so it was much cheaper than usual and B) because it’s waterproof - I’ve no idea why that mattered to me but it was a cool selling point above the others types of ebook reader.When it arrived I immediately went to work adding it to Wifi and downloading a few books. I discovered I could read my kindle in daylight, direct sunlight and in a pitch black room as well as (and this part really is amazing) I could resize the txt and change the font! This meant I could read my kindle without my glasses.... because of this, I’ve managed to read several books since it arrived and In fact I’ve read more books this last month than I have in the last 10 years due to not having to struggle to read the text anymore. I’ve kindle really is one of the very best things I’ve ever purchased."
Readers Together,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic. Best Kindle yet.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 October 2019,"This is by far the best Kindle I've ever had. I love the storage capacity. I love that it's waterproof so don't have to worry about it getting wet at the side of the pool, or if accidentally dropped in the bath. It's so easy to use and responses to touch well. Having the audio aspect is amazing, I love that I can listen to my audiobooks via the Kindle now, the only downside is that there isn't a headphone jack so you need to use Bluetooth headphones - which of course, is why it's waterproof - it would be nice if there was an option."

Esam Zainal,4.0 out of 5 stars,Problem with Power Button,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 November 2020,"I had several Kindle models before, and I found this one incrementally better than the previous model in all aspects: the display contrast is slightly better, it's lighter, and for the same screen size the device size is a bit smaller. It's very comfortable for holding for a long time. However, there is one irritating problem: the power button is so soft, and is sticking out, and is at the bottom!! So when I recline the device on a surface (e.g. table, counter, in airplane, etc.) to free my hands, it very easily switches off! It's so annoying! Sometimes, with a longer inadvertent press, it does a device reset and then I have to wait for a couple of minutes! So unthought of. Why couldn't they put the power button at the top? Then you wouldn't have this problem, and it's more natural too. The older models didn't have this problem (although their buttons were at the bottom too). So at the end I got myself a cutting blade and shaved off the portion of the button that is sticking out, and made it flush with the device case. Problem is now solved!"
Mrs. Joanna Miller,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed I didn’t research the features before purchasing.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 July 2019,"I didn’t research the product when I decided to replace my old Kindle Fire which was having battery charging issues. Initially I was happy with the size and the lightweight of it. I don’t like the layout of the display of books that I have. I preferred the swipe screen on the Kindle Fire to the touch screen to turn page. Then I realised that the Paperwhite is completely monochrome. I preferred colour on  my book covers. I get frustrated with the bookmark feature, having to hit the + or - rather than just tapping the bookmark on and off.I didn’t realise it is just a book reader and that I can’t add apps or access the internet. All in all, it’s ok as a reader but not if you want other features."
MadMax,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great new generation but problem with Bluetooth connection for audible books.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2019,Always had Paper White as my way to read. Wanted to listen to Audio books especially while on the plain or train so upgraded to the latest model. Great screen and battery life but they have introduced a software bug in one of the updates that makes the Bluetooth stop working or loose it's connection. So if you are going to buy one hold fire or if you have one that appears to be faulty it's not do not listen to their BS they know it's a known problem that they still have not fixed. Swapping out the unit or resetting it will not solve the problem.
veronica lewis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great buy to replace my original kindle.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2019,I got this to update my kindle as I have an original one. It's perfect after many yrs of not being able to use my old one due to my deteriorating eyesight with the help of the back light I have started reading again and it's wonderful. I have always loved to read in fact it's always been an obsession so I'm very happy with my purchase it's my Christmas present to myself and the fact that I get to only pay £19 a month for 5 months was a bonus as I'm disabled and live on a limited budget. So am exceedingly happy all round.
wendy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 August 2020,"I bought this to replace my 10 year old Kindle (with keyboard) which eventually gave up on me.  This is a great choice for me, the bonus of having an adjustable backlight is great.  It is smaller than my last one and much lighter, this will fit in my handbag much easier.  I was able to log in to my account and all my books transferred onto my new kindle and the exact book i was reading - what a relief.Would definitely recommend this kindle."
Lucy S,2.0 out of 5 stars,Stopped working after only a few uses,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 February 2021,"Unfortunately, at around 18mths old and after only a handful of uses, my Kindle touchscreen no longer works.  I have contacted Amazon, but unfortunately it is out of warranty which is a real shame.  Amazon help were not able to fix it with me over the chat so I am now left with an unusable Kindle which they believe has broken due to it not being updated with the latest software.  They have offered to trade it in which will give me a % towards a new Kindle, but at the price the Kindle Paperwhite is, I'd have expected to have more than a few uses of it before it stopped working for me, regardless of it being over a year old by a few months."
Sikander,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product but check which version of paper white you're buying!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 March 2020,"I upgraded to this kindle because I liked the sound of it being waterproof and my old paper white had got pretty bashed around over time. The first thing I noticed was that the form factor is similar to before but a little bit slimmer and easier to hold – so far so good. However, as soon as I started using the device I was getting bombarded with advertising for stuff I'm never going to buy. I realise now that this is what the “with Special Offers” tag means in the product title – every time you switch the kindle off or on you get hit with annoying adverts on the sleep screen.It's really wasn't made clear before purchasing that if you buy this version you're signing up to getting spammed for the life of the product. Amazon, you need to fix this and communicate more clearly about it! If I'd known, I would've paid a bit extra to avoid this. You've made a previously very satisfied user really unhappy. As it is, my reading experience is so compromised I'm probably going back to my faithful old kindle with it's battered screen. The irony is,  I can't rate it higher than one star and apart from the spam, it's a good product…UPDATE – Amazon customer service contacted me within hours of writing this review and have removed the Special Offers, so no more adverts! Thanks Amazon, have adjusted the number of stars to reflect the product accordingly!"
lubilu,5.0 out of 5 stars,Anywhere Access to your favourite books,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2021,"Having used Kindle books for a long while now....albeit on a ( PC at first , then a 7 inch and later 10 inch Tablet ) the obvious- biggest disadvantage with ALL portable screens is their reflectiveness , making reading in any sunlight virtually impossible .All that was ""fixed"" by the proper e-book-ink - non-reflective  screen of this KINDLE device.  Retrospectively I wish I`d opted for a Kindle Paperwhite  SOOONER.....!"
jenny g,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic product and service by Amazon,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 April 2019,"what a fantastic gadget and one I thought I'd never get having always enjoyed books.  It is fantastic and has a big storage facility.  I'm looking forward to taking it away on my holidays this year.  So much easier than packing lots of books!  I did have a problem with the screen freezing on the first one I bought but Amazon couldn't have been more helpful.  After following various procedures and Amazon realising it wasn't just a temporary hiccup, I was immediately sent a new one and then returned the faulty one free of charge.  This one has been perfect and is full of books waiting for me to read."
Ray Woodward,4.0 out of 5 stars,The best Kindle yet,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 July 2020,"I've been a long time user of Kindles from the two pre-screen keyboard, and the joystick and paddle versions through to the earliest touchscreen model which has been solid and reliable for many many years. So what makes this Kindle worth the upgrade?The first is the Bluetooth Audio connection. Listening to audiobooks as well as reading has become almost daily routines with Audible making journeys as well as sitting at home playing music through headphones and Hi-Fi simple and easy.The second is that it's finally OK to read while relaxing in the bath without the risk of dosing off and… well you can guess the rest.The nicest part though is the usability. The interface feels more accurate and responsive. Previously I found the touchscreen mildly annoying with swipes on the main screen being mistaken for book selections (and vice versa) and menus being slow to respond to inputs. The new screen is very easy on the eye especially at night and the older model's screen seems greener than the comparatively pure white. It also performs better in both brightly lit and dark environments and infinitely less tiring on the eye than a laptop screen, opted for the 32GB model to accommodate my rather ridiculous number of books and audiobooks I like to have to hand: there are so many out-of-copyright non-DRM .mobi formatted classic Victorian and 20th Century books available that are a pleasure to enjoy alongside the simply huge number of Kindle formatted books to borrow and buy.AccessoriesI recommend getting a case (I went with a grey Amazon cloth covered waterproof case - the experience in terms of size and weight is that of a small-midsize paperback - with the added advantage it switches on when the cover is opened and it's firmly held shut and turns off when you close it (the magnets in the cover also keep the front cover firmly attached to the back of the case, and therefore out of the way, after it's open.I've stuck with Kindle from the outset and even though I have checked out competitors' products I've always found  the Kindle Paper-white to have a superior feel.There are two reasons that I don't give this Kindle a full 5 star rating. Firstly is their continued closed-market approach with incompatibility with pretty much anything but the proprietary format Kindle books and .mobi formatted (non-DRM) books, making it impossible to read even the open standard .epub format books widely available, or even directly loading PDF documents which verges on the ridiculous.The second issue is not choosing a form-factor and sticking to it. My older Kindles remain in use or have been donated to charities - I don't like the increased consumer waste resulting from tweaking the size and shape of Kindles resulting in the huge increase in associated wasted materials consumed with needing to buy new cases every time I buy a new device. That said the packaging is recyclable.I hope this helps you weigh up the pros and cons of buying this waterproof Kindle PaperWhite and associated cover. Overall it's a great device having the ability to take a literal library of books anywhere in something the size of a small paperback is something I use daily."
Mrs. J. S. Harrold,3.0 out of 5 stars,Slimmer and lighter but not as easy to navigate,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 March 2019,"I like the weight and size of the new kindle, it’s excellent for carrying about with me and the back light is a very good feature, better than the one included in the cover of my old kindle and to be honest if I’d never had a kindle before I would probably have rated it 5 stars.  I haven’t though as my old kindle was so much easier, quicker and better to navigate. All my books once read were filed in collections, by author,  (which incidentally haven’t successfully transferred to this new one) so my home page listed the collections followed by the books I’d yet to read (whether they were bought, prime reading or borrowed from the library) and any samples I might have.  On my new kindle all my books are there individually and I have to trawl through several hundred to try and find what I haven’t read or want to read. This is time consuming and extremely irritating especially when scrolling up I keep opening books I don’t want to and have to keep going back. It was a much simpler and quicker system (seconds rather than several frustrating minutes) on the old kindle and far less stressful. In fact I’ve been referring back to my old kindle to identify what I’m looking for and/or checking on contents and devices to see what I’ve most recently acquired.  This does outweigh the good but I will persevere as I love my kindle reading and do want to embrace this new lighter, slimmer model but I am disappointed that some of the changes certainly take away from the customer experience unfortunately probably in favour of cutting costs."
Joy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Converted !,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 February 2020,"I'm a convert ! I've resisted e-readers for ages, preferring physical books.While I still love the feel and experience of a book, this is so convenient.It's easy to carry around, and fits more than enough books ( I bought the 8 GB).The screen is so easy on the eye, and you can take it literally anywhere !I had the Kindle app for a few years,  but it used to hurt my eyes after using it. That was another reason I didn't buy a Kindle.Brilliant !"
MRS D REID,3.0 out of 5 stars,So-so,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 February 2019,"I’m not necessarily knocking this e-reader but I’ve had 4 kindles previously. The original keyboard one, the basic side buttons one, a kindle fire and the original paper white. My husband bought me this as an upgrade to the previous kindle paper white. The only part that separates this from my other paper white is the waterproof part. The battery life is actually worse. The on/off button on the bottom means you actually knock it off whilst in the middle of reading.All in all if this is your first kindle you’ll probably love it. If you’re thinking of upgrading from the old paperwhite, just buy a waterproof case from Amazon."
D. Eves,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 November 2018,"As a frequent traveller this is a great device. Light and small to hold. The backlight is activated automatically which means I can now read at nigh on a sleeper train without the need to hold a book and wear a head torch. The additional of audiobooks is logical and the connection to WiFi and Bluetooth is easy. I spent the extra £10 to remove the special offers though these weren’t that intrusive. Battery time is excellent. Furthermore, I realise my reading has increased as the Kindle offers just two options to read or listen. This avoids the iPad issue of multiple app choices which can lend itself to drifting from one option to another without finishing anything."
Patrick W,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Good device, but just over a year in, battery won't charge",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 April 2020,"I'd like to add another buyer-beware review in terms of product durability. The device itself is a good one, but shortly after a year of surprisingly quick decaying battery life, the device will no longer charge at all, rendering it useless. It would be cynical to point out this has happened just after replacement warranty ran out, but the battery life has been getting shorter and shorter almost from purchase. If you're thinking about buying one, be aware you might need to buy another one a lot sooner than you'd like."
val,4.0 out of 5 stars,My kindle updated,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 November 2018,"Slightly smaller than my last one so I had to purchase a new cover. I have had a few issues with the page changes, sometimes I need to tap more than once to go to next page, on occasion this has resulted in multiple pages being turned and I have had to search for the page I was reading. I will be monitoring this issue and contacting Amazon if it happens more often."
Sooo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very easy to read and use any time of day - love it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 November 2019,"I'll still read paper books, but love this Kindle.. Very easy to read and use and very light.  Can read on lower light when needed so you're not disturbing anyone if you are a late night/ early morning reader.  Love the dictionary option - quick check into a thesaurus or dictionary for any more obscure words the author may have used.Has been great to be able to share books and browse new ones.  Love it!Can also recommend buying an auto switch off case - just flip the cover over to use or close your 'book'"
Prooro,4.0 out of 5 stars,No headphone socket but great to read in the sun...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 July 2019,Brilliant to sit in the sun and read with but for the money I felt the overall quality wasn’t as good as I’d expected. Very slow and interface feels old fashioned compared to a phone but it does what I bought it for well ie sit and read outdoors without any glare. Unfortunately it doesn’t have a socket for headphones so although it promotes itself on being able to access Audible it only does it through Bluetooth and I don’t have any Bluetooth headphones to pair with. It is easy to hold but I bought a cover which acts as a stand so I don’t even have to hold it.

Eddie Bates,5.0 out of 5 stars,Any Book at Your Fingertips,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 October 2020,"I am very pleased with this purchase.  I have always enjoyed reading books of all sorts of genres, and with the kindle, I am now able to access any book I require almost at the touch of a button.  I am able to adjust the font, brightness, layout, etc to whatever is required at the time and, all in all, the convenience and adaptability of the kindle outweighs the feel and look of an actual book.  The kindle is a quality item and good value for money."
Teresa Alliband,3.0 out of 5 stars,No sepia option,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2018,"Having had my lovely kindle with keyboard for many years, the screen broke when abroad recently I decided to get the new paper white. It is nice and compact and lovely to be able to read anywhere as it has the light option but a big drawback is that it does not have the option to change the page colour to sepia, which is what I normally have my devices with backlights set to, which is less harsh on the eye. This is disappointing as it does state you can change the colour of the page but this only has the option to change to black with white writing."
elaine page,2.0 out of 5 stars,"small screen, have to turn page to much",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 May 2020,"Bought this to replace my old kindle which I'd had for years, wish I had taken more time in choosing a replacement, this feels really flimsy and cheap, also its my own fault but wish I hadent bought a 6 inch one, seems hardly any story on the page before you have to turn over, and turning the page is a hit and miss affair, with hindsight wish as soon as I'd received this kindle I had sent it straight back, for someone having their first kindle I guess it may be fine, or for a child would probably be good because it's really light, though to me it feels cheap and plastic like, and I do not like the home page layout, not conceise like my old one even though I paid the extra for no specialsAll in all so wish I had not purchased this kindle, and bought another kindle fire"
Jane Doe,4.0 out of 5 stars,New Kindle Paperwhite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 November 2018,In the first week of using it it crashed three times - garbled nonsense.  Fortunately it righted itself after restarting it each time and hasn't had a recurrence since - touch wood!  The main menu (listing books) is much lighter than my old version which is not so good for those with glasses and I am slightly annoyed over the fact that it seems necessary to tick each book as and when I read it - I know when I've read a book oddly enough.  Frankly I couldn't care a less about it being waterproof since I don't read it in the bath but I would like the ability to adjust it to my usage and if anyone knows how to alter the above two items I'd be most grateful.
Tony S,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great device that got me reading again!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 August 2019,"So, before I review the paperwhite, I'll share the reason I purchased it.I was on holiday & as always, dusted off my original Kindle (the original type with the keyboard at the bottom) so I had something to read whilst away.I started & finished Ant Middleton's autobiography & then reverted back to Damon Hill's autobiography on my second week.It was during the second week that I accidentally leant on my Kindle when getting up form the subbed. Instant cracked screen & worse still, stuck at 75% read when I was on track to read the remainder of the book before going home.Try as I might to read the rest using my phone, the screen was just too shiny to read in the sunlight next toileting the pool.As soon as we got home, I ordered the Paperwhite now that I was back into reading after a long break.I ordered it & the next day was the proud owner of a new Paperwhite, along with the Amazon case for it.Soon, I was reunited with Damon Hill's autobiography & before long it was completed.Now I can't put it down!Love the touch screen which is surprisingly responsive. As per my old Kindle, I love that I can read it in direct sunlight, but now also with the added peace of mind that this one is waterproof.Only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is a personal thing where I wish I had purchased the non-advert version.Small niggle, but otherwise a great device."
carb,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 April 2019,"I was rather disappointed with my kindle, because it is black and white it is difficult to see the the front of the book and read its title and you cannot zoom in to look closer. I was also hoping that it would put the unread books handy to find and read without scrolling through pages of other books to find the ones you haven’t read yet. Another disappointment was the fact that I cannot get any other applications on the device apart from kindle books. I got a high GB one in order to relieve my IPad of space from all reading material but it won’t support epub or pdf. Yes very disappointed."
William R. Woods,4.0 out of 5 stars,New Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 July 2020,I damaged my 1st kindle so this is a replacement. I don't think for somebody like me who doesn't always go for the latest model it is any better in fact I dislike the touch screen tho' my children tell me I'll get used to it. With the old one I could turn the page on or back from both sides of the screen which I found helpful. You can't on this one. I can sum up my feelings by saying that I will try & get the old one repaired.
belle23,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow wow wow,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 January 2020,I cannot recommend this paperwhite enough. I had the very 1st kindle released. It served me well till last year. I damaged the central vision in one eye. I found my original kindle too dark to read. I downloaded the kindle app onto my laptop. That was worse it was too bright so couldn't concentrate on the writing. So got my husband to buy me this for Christmas. Its amazing perfect brightness. Its so good I'm back to reading a book in 2 days. My eye doesn't get tired as it did. Cannot recommend this enough.
Sue Gough,5.0 out of 5 stars,Another Brilliant Kindle!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2020,"I absolutely love my new Kindle Paperwhite.  It was bought as a Christmas present for me from my husband. My old one was getting a bit slow as it was quite old.  The new Kindle is  lighter than my original Kindle Paperwhite which is a bonus when carrying it around with me.  This new version is much faster to charge and holds its charge longer.  The new flat screen is great.  I also love the fact that it's waterproof so I will not have to worry about it getting splashed with water, especially whilst on holiday.  There's a few modifications to the old version but I believe these are for the better. All in all a brilliant Kindle."
joaidferg,5.0 out of 5 stars,Big improvement on older kindle's,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 June 2019,"I have been using an original Kindle for many years, as in the very first type. I thought it was time for a change so went to the latest Paperwhite (2018) version.  I have to say I am very pleased with it. Touch screen is just right for sensitivity, navigation is SO MUCH EASIER. Some people bemoan the absence of actual buttons to turn the page, why? the page turning by a touch or flick is perfect. The only thing I would point out is that if, like me, you have the illumination turned up quite high, it does use up battery fairly fast. but charging is very fast. Overall a big thumbs up."
Lis,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for holiday reading in the sunshine,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 April 2019,"I have been using my kindle fire for holiday reading and listening, but found I could not see the screen in sunshine, so could not even access my audible stories, my old paper white kindle had worn out and did not support audible. So fed up when returned from holiday I ordered the new paper white which support audible, with blue tooth head phones I did my ironing in double time through listening to stories with no wires attached. I could even stay listening while putting it away. I have yet to try it in sunshine, but am sure it will perform just as well. If it does not I will be sure to report . Nice light item to put in handbag for holidays"
Kirsty,1.0 out of 5 stars,Do not buy!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 May 2020,I bought this kindle back in December as a chrismtas present for my husband after his previous kindle stopped being able to be charged. After reading the reviews I thought I would be able to trust that with this new version we would encounter no problems. Only 5 months down the line and again the kindle will not charge and won't turn on. I have followed several tutorials online on how to fix and nothing has worked. I'm devastated particularly now being in isolation and not being able to use the kindle when it's been needed most. There is no clear way on how to return it or have a refund or who to contact on my amazon account. Very dissatisfied.
vanessa foulkes,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 April 2020,"Love this so much. I was wondering if to get one or not  as I love reading a book, so decided I would try  . never looked back great item .. I struggle with the brightness of natural light or sunlight so always find it hard to read in sunlight but with this there’s no need to worry or struggle.. when in the sun it’s great no glare nothing. so light so can have it with your where ever you go..  Easy to useI love it I would definitely recommend"
T_London,2.0 out of 5 stars,Does not allow you to retrieve highlights made in books not purchased through Amazon.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 April 2020,"I was happy with my kindle until I could not download the notes and highlights I made to a book simply because I did not purchase it directly from Amazon.I purchased three e-books from a publisher, downloaded them as Kindle content (mobi) and sent them to myself by email. So far, so good! I read one of the books, made annotations to it, etc. Then, when I tried to send the notes to myself, there was no option to do so. I then visited the 'read' webpage on Amazon and could not find the books. After much research, I saw that Amazon categorises them as 'docs' rather than 'books' and I could only seen them in the 'device and content' webpage. The problem with this categorisation is that you don't have the same choices as you would if you had bought the books from Amazon. What a monopoly! This is infuriating! I then tried to connect the Kindle to my new PC! No success! My computer didn't even register that it was plugged. I looked online, tried in three different countries (PCs and a Mac) and with three different leads (I first tried with the one that came with the Kindle). Again, no success! I noticed, while I was looking for info on line, that lots of people are having the same issues when trying to connect their kindle to a computer. It seems that this is a problem that has been going on for a good while but nothing is being done by Amazon to fix it."
Frugal Dougal,3.0 out of 5 stars,Wouldn’t charge.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 June 2019,"First off, my new kindle will not charge.  It arrived on 49% and having run that down to about 20% I decided to recharge it.  Unfortunately it won,t.  Consequently, I am returning this for a replacement.I have had an older model of Kindle since about 2009 and felt that it was a great piece of kit.  My wife bought me this as a present.  Unfortunately, I find that the touch screen is way too sensitive and you only need brush it with a finger and it changes page.  However, the border surrounding the screen seems to be much smaller than my older kindle which means I end up inadvertently touching the screen way too often.Lastly, due to the March of technology for things to be smaller and lighter, this newer kindle lacks any weight to it, much lighter than my older Kindle.  When holding it it’s almost as if there is nothing in your hand.  Some people may like that, I found that as a replacement for a book, an ebook, it should retain some trace of the heft of a book, even if only for the nostalgics."
laura,5.0 out of 5 stars,Waterproof,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 December 2018,"I am still very sad at the loss of my original kindle by accidentally putting it in the washing machine.  This new one is waterproof and possibly would have survived as it was just the first 10 mins of a handwash cycle.  Since I'm stupid enough to regularly do that sort of thing I'm hoping this one will live for longer.  It's heavier and a slightly smaller screen than the original but the light has already been handy on a dark winter train journey and reading in the dark while my baby goes to sleep.  I loved my original kindle and this one has exactly the same features.  I've not really noticed any other increases so it does seem expensive for a light, but the waterproofing will hopefully save it in the next disaster so will be worth it."
Rigsby,1.0 out of 5 stars,Good whilst it worked but it has failed within 12 months of purchase,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 October 2019,"I took delivery of the kindle paper white on 21st November 2018. Up until now it has been fine and worked well but it has now developed a battery fault. The battery will not hold charge. I charged it to 100% and disconnected the charger at 8am this morning and with wi-fi switched off and the kindle in sleep mode all day, the battery was at 11% charge by 5pm.This fault is now persistent as it is the fourth consecutive time that this has happened. An e-reader with a battery life of 9 hours is no good to me."
Heather,1.0 out of 5 stars,waste of money,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 March 2020,"My husband bought this for me as a Christmas  present to take on holidays. When I first got it I had trouble charging it. The problem has been constant every time I have picked it up to read it has always had a dead battery. It has now reached the point where it won't charge at all, so as you can see I won't give it any star rating. I have also not been able to get a case to fit the kindle. I want to return this item and recieve my husbands money back. I have not found a way to return this item."
GuitarmanAlan,5.0 out of 5 stars,This new Kindle is Brilliant!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2018,"As you may expect I use my Kindle to read e-books! It is much better to use than my old one with easier settings for font size, the ability to check the time with a simple tap on the top of the screen, where other functions and settings can be found.Being an avid night time reader, the back light is perfect for myself as it allows me to read in the dark, thus not disturbing my wife, the touch screen also doesn't click as the older one does.The only problem I have, and I suspect it is because I have unusually dry skin on my hands, is that on occasion, the page fails to turn at the first attempt.Throughly recommended!"
Angela Dixon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2020,"This is the first Kindle ive ever bought, ive had the app on my phone for a good  few years and have enjoyed using it.  Thats why i was really surprised that everything on my new Kindle is in black and  white.  Obviously im not talking about the text, but the book covers in my library.  Im used to them being in colour, which they are im the app, makes the whole  thing look really drab.  Its like going back to my childhood when we had a black and  white TV.  Why aren’t they in colour Amazon?"
Mr Michael Robbins,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very touch senesitive,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2018,"This is a good replacement for my original Paperwhite. It appears to have a longer battery life as it 'wakes up' when you open the cover. It is slightly thinner than the original and the screen is just as bright with what appears to be a brighter higher setting. My only 'concern' if you can call it that, is that the touch screen seems to be more sensitive and when holding the kindle it is easy to select previous or next page by inadvertently touching the screen. Overall I have given it 5 stars  as I can down load lots of books and it comes with on my journeys around the world. (it has also downloaded my entire library from my previous paperwhite.) Great device."
Andrew B-Smith,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product - shame about the help font size,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2018,"My wife's sight is deteriorating rapidly due to diabetic macular oedema.After using my Kindle with an enlarged font size,  we agreed that this would help her continue to read her Bible in particular.  However, as we set up her new Kindle, we realised that the various help pop-up messages are not in an enlarged font even though the font has been set for a larger size. Please can Amazon consider how they can overcome this drawback.The kindle itself was easy to set up and I had it running for her within a few minutes (shipping with a battery that has already been charged is a real plus - well done!)Finally, an irritant. Amazon sell Kindles without ads for an extra £10, so charge £10 if you upgrade a standard Kindle to a ""no ads"" version. However, if you switch a ""no ads"" Kindle to an ads version, Amazon does not refund you the extra £10. So it's heads they win, tails we lose. It would be fairer that anyone who decides that they want ads after all should have the extra £10 refunded IN THE INTERESTS OF FAIRNESS."
Litcrit.,5.0 out of 5 stars,The kindle is very useful if you travel on public transport regularly.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 August 2019,"This is my second Kindle. I like to use it when travelling as I can keep it in my bag & it doesn’t take up lots of space or when being used in public - on the train.It is an efficient way of keeping g up with books you want to read but space saving & very easy to order in new titles & samples, which is an excellent way to browse before buying books.I am hoping the battery will be more efficient than the first version which needed very regular boosting.The print sizes & fonts give plenty of options. I really am pleased to have a new one to rely on."
A. Hadley,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight and excellent value.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 July 2020,"I was devastated, when my Paper white developed a hardware fault, which was, irreparable. By coincidence I had received an email about the latest version. Having had a consultation with a very helpful advisor who provided me with a 15% discount to replace my existing Kindle, I ordered the new version and am extremely pleased that I did. All my content was, available and it even picked up on the location in my current book."
LD,5.0 out of 5 stars,Glad I repurchased newer model!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2019,"Love it! I previously had an old model who’s battery started dying too quickly so gave in and bought a new one. It’s definitely improved, a bit smaller (so old case didn’t fit) but feels lighter and I love the smooth front. With the older model bits of dirt would get caught between the edge of screen and frame so none of that now. I have the version with ads, doesn’t bother me at all, when I’m not using it I’m not looking at it! That’s the only time they’re there, when my case is closed. And the battery is great, I read for at least an hour most days, it’s going down roughly 20% per week. That’s with backlight off as I only really read during the day. All round, definitely glad I repurchased!Update - 7 weeks exactly since received and 1st 100% charged, not charged once since, still reading pretty much every day, now often with backlight on when inside due to the weather, it’s at 15% charge. DLd several books too if that makes a diff, otherwise always on aeroplane mode. Couldn’t be more impressed with the battery and performance!! Well done Amazon! I’m going to keep going to almost zero then charge it. I’ve read batteries have a sort of ‘capacity memory’ so best to let them drain fully rather than always topping to 100."
gilltotherescue,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good and not so good.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 September 2019,"I like the lightness of the Kindle but not keen on only being able to hold it around the outside. My fingers have strayed and changed pages many times now. Preferred my old kindle for turning pages, not keen on swiping or tapping especially if I am holding it in one hand. Also on my old Kindle I was able via the menu to view my archived books, about 25 pages, but now I cannot find them. That was handy to view which authors I have read before I buy another book. The backlight is very good for reading at night without disturbing anyone else though."
DeficitDora,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Excellent! Lightweight, comfy in the hand and simple to use.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 July 2019,"This was a birthday present to me, and I am completely enamoured of it! It does everything I need it to do and it is simple and intuitive to use. The built in light is great for night time reading, and it doesn't disturb the person next to you in bed. The best thing, though, is it's so light and fits in my hand without any discomfort after a long reading session. I'm a bit late to the world of kindles, although I've used the app on my iPad, and I'm certainly not ready to ditch physical books. But this is going to save a shed load of trees! Love it."
Droigheann,1.0 out of 5 stars,Ads which can't be got rid of,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 November 2020,"Bought it to replace my aging Kindle Voyage. It won't until that one dies. First, they wouldn't deliver it to a country with no Amazon store (had to use another e-commerce store as a sort of broker). I have it now and so far the only difference between this and the Voyage seems to be that on the Home screen you don't get 8 titles from your library per page but 7, because the bottom is occupied by an obtrusive advert banner that apparently can't be got rid of. Not to mention that ads also appear as screensavers. Summary: great disappointment."
Paul,5.0 out of 5 stars,Small significant improvements,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 June 2019,"From my last Kindle there are significant improvements, especially around the waterproofing. This mean baths, rainy bus stops, and beside swimming pools are all places I'll not be stressing out instead of relaxing!My only real grumble is that i wonder if kindles have a built in obsolescence; this is my third Kindle over which I've read about 45 books. so at around 22 books per kindle its costing me around £4 a book for the privilege/convenience of using the kindle over a real book - not really economical even if digital copies tend to cost a little less."
acquirer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Bought this to rplace one which I bought 2 years ago.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2021,"I cannot understand how different this one is.Why is it dull and dingy? It is tiring on the eyes to read it for more than a few minutes. The text is greyish and the light is dull. I am using it on the charge with which it came, and there might be an improvement when it is time for a new charge? BUT how is it possible to ask anyone at Amazon this question? With the small charge left in the previous one, the difference is so very distinct.DJH"
McNally,5.0 out of 5 stars,We'll worth the investment.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 September 2019,"Resisted buying a Kindle as a big physical book buyer but this is great. I do a lot of business travel and books rarely survived the flights etc without creasing or scuffs. I tend to buy stuff I'd never really keep on the shelves. Airport stuff, fast food equivalent reading matter and this is perfect. I won't give up physical books but this is a great add on. The Kindle itself isn't perfect. I'd like colour covers and a more intuitive OS - the web search is pretty poor - but it is worth pulling the trigger on a Black Friday. No regrets and actually reading far more than previously so clear value on that score alone."
Lelia,3.0 out of 5 stars,Light to hold but fiddly sometimes,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 September 2020,Really enjoyed this product it was light and easy at night to read which I did most nights and daytime. Its a bit fiddly getting the right font size on this and highlighting sentences but all in all it has been a great thing to read books on. But I bough this product just over a year ago now and sadly it has completely died so no chance of a refund or replacement. Also I did get this on a good promotion 79.99 so I'm gutted right now I can't afford to replace it at this moment in time due it being the pandemic and money is tight. Ah well it was nice while it lasted.
Anna,5.0 out of 5 stars,The world's my oyster!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2020,"Absolutely delighted with my Kindle. Wish I'd taken the plunge years ago. As an avid reader and lover of books, I can now afford to try out lots more at reasonable cost and no fear of being crowded out of my house by bookshelves! The initial outlay was worth every penny. The quality is good, the size just right, and so convenient. And I can go exploring and pop another title in whenever I see one! Wow. What's not to like?"
mrose,3.0 out of 5 stars,Complicated,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 October 2020,"I had an old side button reader and I loved it simple straight forward. I changed as the battery was not lasting. I find this one is temperamental touch screen jumps about if you are not completely lined up and it is difficult to use left handed as it always turns back in stead of forward, it is too fussy and complicated for a reader"
Aron A.,5.0 out of 5 stars,A near perfect product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 April 2020,"I have to say that my last kindle lasted for about three years before I looked at upgrading and I am really glad that I did! It’s everything that you can possibly want from a kindle but also they seem to have fixed some of the issues that plagued the previous models (slow loading times, bad touchscreen). I would highly recommend this product. We all know the benefits of having a kindle are by now so I won’t list them but this model does all of that and more."
Chris Taylor,3.0 out of 5 stars,Battery life is a problem on this product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2019,Despite the claims of longevity the battery kept running out every week without me hardly using the product and without the back light being on very bright at all. Having visited several forums there were a lot of discussions about this problem. The discussion centred on wifi on off and airplane mode on and off. Some said it made no difference and some did. It does. I switched airplane mode off and now the battery lasts weeks. This is a ridiculous problem and completely spoils and otherwise good product.
MissBlade,5.0 out of 5 stars,Sublime.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 January 2020,Great battery.Flush screen.Water resistantVery light and perfect for my handbag.Kindle store has plenty of deals.I also download books from elsewhere and install.

A Paul,4.0 out of 5 stars,Stupid power button placement. Otherwise good.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 June 2019,Great e reader. Questionable build quality as I've had one randomly die on me whilst at an airport when I really needed it. Thankfully Amazon have a good replacement policy. Second has been fine so far. One thing that is just stupid is the placement of the power button. It sits right where it is comfortable to hold with your right hand so you end up accidently pressing it while reading all the time causing it to lock. How did the designers not think of that? Put it on the top or make it a toggle switch like on a kobo. Other than that the device works great.
Leftover Stu,4.0 out of 5 stars,This is no miracle product but...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2019,"... it does what it is supposed to do. I'm finding pairing with Bose mini speaker or bluetooth earphones to be particularly frustrating and a bit hit and miss. I expected better. Once the minefield of purchasing books / audiobooks, and avoiding ending up with two copies of the same book, is achieved it is convenient and compact. Does it Perform any better than your iPhone and Kindle app? Not that I've found yet but it's early days. As an occasional reader, would I buy it again? Perhaps, probably not. Concentrate on the already established Ios version and save the money if you already have the iphone or ipad."
Thimbletack,4.0 out of 5 stars,Lightweight easy to handle.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 February 2020,"Perhaps I haven't learned how to use my Kindle properly, but I don't like the way it always jumps to the book I am busy reading. Sometimes I just want to browse the library to see what is available, or check out the offers.Also, sometimes, even the slightest touch on the screen turns the page, which can be momentarily confusing if you didn't see it happen. Overall though it's handy to have, offering a wide range of subjects and books that I probably wouldn't even consider if browsing in a bookshop."
giftaid,5.0 out of 5 stars,Simply Wonderful,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 July 2019,"I had to buy a new kindle as sadly my 2013 one had gone to the land of dead electronics. I loved my old one and wondered what ""improvements"" had been made to the latest version. I had no reason to be wary as the new kindle is even better than my old beloved one. All my books were on as soon as I registered all I had to do was bring down my current book and continue reading. I also bought a new cover that puts it to sleep when closed and is much smaller than my old one. Free delivery and only took three days to arrive , whats not to love !!"
Rhona Marshall,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very Handy,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 February 2020,"Pros- This is my first ever Kindle and although it isn't as nice as a physical book, the perks are so handy! It is very light which works well for me as I like to bring books with me when I travel (on holiday and the daily commute). Also means you only have to bring one and not a heavy library. I would say it is actually easier to hold in bed than a book and easier to change the page whilst you are all snuggled up. I read a lot in the bath, so being waterproof is essential! It is much easier to access the books you want to read and cheaper. I love the 99p books however the sequels are usually more expensive, clever marketing there. The battery life is very long which is good.Cons- I found it quite difficult to figure out how it worked and have had to google the instructions multiple times. Thankfully once you are told though, it is easy. Could do with a better manual included."

The added bonus is the availability of so many free books.If you're thinking of buying one - don't hesitate - really pleased with mine :)"
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Customer service was really bad.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 December 2018,"I loved the new kindle paper white 4.  It was nice to listen to audio on it, without the interruption of email and phone calls.Loved:Lovely clear screenThe size was nice and I brought the official waterproof cover that felt really nice.The device felt faster than the Paperwhite 3Disliked:The Bluetooth on the device stopped working after two weeks.  It happens not a problem so I thought.  Phoned customer services, spoke to two people, the first person did the usual ereaders your device start again and see if it works.  Unfortunately all the standard checks did not work, so I was passed on to another advisor.  I spent over an hour on the phone, the advisor did not have a clue, at one stage even told me that the devices Bluetooth was not working because I don't have Bluetooth, from there it got worse.  In the end after being really stressed for over an hour she eventually agreed to send me a replacement.I take of a star for really bad customer service, which really surprises me as I have not had a problem before.Hopefully the replacement will have no problems."
Mrs D H Goodman,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love It,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 November 2019,So glad I bought this. Originally I bought an Amazon Fire thinking that it would do so much more than just being a Kindle - which it does & I love it BUT if as an avid reader I found the Fire too heavy for hours of reading and if I wanted to read in a sunny room the reflection on the screen was a problem. This Page White is a delight. It's compact and lightweight. You can easily hold it in one hand & turn the page by just tapping the screen with your thumb. It is much easier on the eyes & there is no bad light to read it in as it copes with a!l levels of light. I love it!
amackem,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A great reader, day or night, wet or dry",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 October 2020,"This was bought for my wife, to replace an older model, I have the same modelIt is great especially for me when at work, I work shift work including nights and on down time the back light is great.It’s small enough to fit in my pocket, and virtually the same weight as my mobile.Worth every penny.And the water resistant feature is a god send when on holiday around the pool when it gets splashed"
Jamie-Leigh Roehrig,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 October 2019,"First ever Kindle!I usually love books, especially for holidays but they always add to the weight limit and it's sometimes so difficult to decide which ones to take so thought I would try a Kindle. I'm so so so happy with it! So light to hold (can easily hold it in one hand) and it's so easy to use. I love the lighting, not like the lighting on a phone or tablet that gives you a headache, it feels like a real book! It's easy to find books (I subscribed to kindle unlimited) and there's so many books to chose from, it's like a library service, you can borrow up to 10, return the read ones and borrow more.So happy with my purchase and cannot wait to take it on holiday!"
Al,5.0 out of 5 stars,It was like moving from candle light to electricity!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 May 2019,"My previous kindle was a generation 4 kindle reader, which up to now had been the only kindle I'd ever had. It worked fine, and I could read on it but it started to get display problems, and after years of use I decided to upgrade.The change is incredible! as much as I love my old kindle the paperwhite is obviously leagues ahead of old faithful, the screen is responsive, tons of storage and the backlight is great too. As far as weight, I did buy the case and it does make it a little heavier, but its the lightest x-amount of hundreds of books i'll ever carry in my bag. Very happy with the paperwhite, definitely an investment."
Red Andy 203,4.0 out of 5 stars,Light and easy to use,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 July 2019,The touchscreen can be a little slow to respond but works well overall the light works well and it is very easy to read.The batty life may be weeks if you only read 1/2 hour a day but if you read a lot more you must keep your eye on it or it will run down without you knowing.A battery life signal whilst reading would be useful instead of just on the home screen
Hannah Lawrence,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed and frustrated with your serviced Amazon,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 July 2020,This Kindle is too heavy I asked for the new Oasis as a present from my son and Amazon sent paperwhite which for me is useless I am 84 and have lost most of my strength to hold things I cannot get it back to him to return to you because of the Covid Virus and shielding.  I am sure an Oasis was ordered because it was not available for several days after my birthday 3rd June and then the paperwhite was delivered on 4th June  so I suspect you are getting rid of old stock because the new Oasis has had a good review.  I feel cheated!!
Elisabeth Kendall,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great technology, but spoilt by ads",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 October 2019,"I was hugely disappointed to find nearly half the ""home"" screen taken up with ads. I took the time to find a workaround to remove the ""recommended reading"". But the banner ad at the bottom can't be removed without some fuss and the payment of £10. Amazon's justification is: Your Kindle would have been £10 more expensive if you'd said you didn't want to see ads. So if you now tick to opt out, we'll charge you £10. This sleight of hand is outrageous and totally out of character for Amazon. Amazon's credibility sinks. The screen is already small - I'd rather see more of my own library displayed on it than a messy collection of what Amazon has decided I should buy. I would have scored it lower, but want to be fair to the excellent technology."
Mike Thornton,5.0 out of 5 stars,With offers version - no.problem,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 October 2020,"I like the built in light and the ability to change font size (im overdue my next eye test...).  I also really like the dark mode.My biggest worry was whether saving a bit of cash to get the ""with offers"" version was a sensible cost saving or not.  I've added photos so you can see the ad's.  Personally I don't find them intrusive or objectionable.  I do like the fact that if I ever change my mind I can pay to have them removed.  I don't think I will be doing that though."
Philip Walker,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, but there is a design issue.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2020,"I love my kindle, and I’ve had a few. This version of the paper white is great.There is a but...I keep accidentally turning it off. I hold it in in my hand, usually with my little finger underneath, and I keep accidentally turning it off. Additionally if I use it on the train which I do a lot, if I try to balance the kindle on the tray, again it will turn off.  I wonder if the power button would be better at the top rather than the bottom?"
Anon,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better Than My Old One - By A Mile!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 July 2019,"Awesome bit of kit.  I had an old one with keyboard & buttons on the side for years.  Had to have a case with a built in light to read at night.This is so light, a great built in light, excellent battery consumption, & easy to use.  The only downside, & it is very minor, in my opinion is that I have been using a Kindle fire for a few months & when turning the pages on that it looked like you were actually turning a page whereas this one just opens the next page.  But as I said very minor & purely cosmetic.Highly recommended!"
Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,Handy device but screen often unresponsive and connection issues,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2021,"Having recently converted from books I have to say it is handy, especially for reading while eating, not having to try and hold the page open and of course really handy to have all your books in one place. The negatives though are not insignificant. Mine will only connect to my main wifi but refuses to connect to the extender, dont have this problem with any other device. The bigger issue though is the touch screen is often slow and sometime completely unresponsive. Doesn't seem to happen while reading but when using menu options. For the price I'd expect it to be a lot smoother. I am writing this while waiting for mine to respond to anything at all, currently stuck on lock screen and swiping to unlock is doing nothing. So in summery a handy device but not without it's downfalls. Would I recommend, no probably not."
Bookworm,4.0 out of 5 stars,very welcome surprise present,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 July 2020,"I was surprised at the battery life: from the 'blurb' I was expecting better performance. I can't comment on the value aspect as I don't know what the purchaser paid.  Obviously limited functionality compared to Amazon Fire etc which I suspect may be the better purchase.  Somewhat smaller that I'd expected - I always assumed they were standard paperback size. Light enough to hold comfortably, but better with a 'stand' cover.  The menus aren't exactly user friendly in my experience though levels of technical ability vary greatly.  The process for accessing audio books appears unwieldy, not least because there doesn't appear to be a speaker facility.  All in all, as per the 'headline', a very welcome surprise present but I'm not sure I would buy one: I think the 'kindle experience' is better on my 10"" tablet though the Paperwhite is much more convenient when travelling."
Andy,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great piece of equipment that I would recommend.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 October 2020,"The kindle Paperwhite is lighter and feels more comfortable when holding for extended periods of time. Also being waterproof is another improvement for when reading by the pool, gives you peace of mind in case it gets wet. The paper white background also makes it easier on the eyes as you don’t have to worry about screen glare. All in all very happy with my new kindle and would recommend to anyone who is thinking of purchasing one."
Tracey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant would recommend,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 August 2020,"Brilliant, I had my original Kindle for  over ten years and it suddenly stopped working.Very easy to link to my account and to access the books I had already got.Would recommend, glad I ordered without special offers too as no adverts coming up"
Dee,5.0 out of 5 stars,WORTH WAITING FOR!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 November 2018,"Have waited some time to upgrade from my original Paperwhite (2012), well I can say it was worth waiting for , the flush glass screen was the first upgrade I was pleased with. Further investigation of the device proved to be a step forward especially the audible Bluetooth option, a more enjoyable experience all round unable to find any ""don't likes at present""Only irritation is that could have paid less due to discount on recent promotion ""black Friday deal"""
Phoebe's Mum,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Smaller than I imagined, but I love it",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 January 2019,"I have a lot of time travelling/waiting around for sporty daughter so invariably go armed with a tablet.  I've been making do with a Kindle Fire (and an iPad app) to read books, but I tend to get distracted by emails/internet browsing.  I've looked at Kindles from time to time and was finally tempted in the Black Friday sales.  The water resistance was a big plus because I spend many hours poolside (so very humid).  This device is a lot smaller than I imagined, but it didn't take long to get used to the smaller pages.  I get ample charge for a long weekend (so no battery packs needed) and it is very light to hold.  The screen adapts well to reading in the dark too."
It's not hoarding when it's books,4.0 out of 5 stars,It will grow on me,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 November 2018,I had an issue when I got it because it came with the wrong USB cable.  The customer Service was not brilliant which was a surprise as they are usually fine.  Instead of them just sending me a new one I had to order a new one and get a credit.  It's the £9.99 Amazon Basics one in case you need to order one.  The whole thing took 2 phone calls and 3 people to sort out.I have an old Kindle and this one is different!  No keyboard at the bottom!  No buttons at the sides!  An awful lot of books to download and put into collections!!!  It does seem to be as slow as my old one which was disappointing.  Apart from all that it seems to be fine and I will grow to know and love it.  (I'm keeping my old one just in case...)
Catherine McCallum,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great backlight,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 November 2019,"Enjoy the back-light feature.  I am what younger ones would call a ""silver surfer"" and a complete techno phobic. I find it very complicated to use and wish there was a booklet with this kindle that explained all the ways to manage . I struggle to find my earliest purchased books and I am not sure what I have pressed while trying to figure things out but now my books are starting at around 30% read and I have to remember how to manage ""start from beginning"" instruction. I so miss my original kindle which was lovely and simple to follow."
helen north,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good value for money,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 August 2019,"I dropped my previous kindle in the hot tub, along with my iPhone XR, the iPhone survived as it’s waterproof sadly my kindle didn’t. I was gutted about my kindle as I loved it and spend hours using it, especially in the hot tub and when in holiday by the pool. Seeing my iPhone survive a dunking prompted me to purchase the waterproof kindle and although it’s not had a dip yet every other aspect of it is brilliant. I also read at night and like to read in the dark so I don’t disturb my husband so the backlight is brilliant, it also dims which is great. The new flush screen is better too. I love it and would recommend it."
mr m,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy reading,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 June 2020,"Old paperwhite died after about 7 years of daily use, bought this new one over the standard new kindle just for bigger memory and more dpi.  Lot quicker to load store and change pages than the old one. The old one had started to struggle to find the next page when reading a large book,  this is quick.  I like the display and just get on with reading without considering the kindle itself which shows how good it is."
vicky peplow,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle disappointment.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 September 2019,"So disappointed with this kindle, I bought this last November after upgrading from previous models.  The battery life is a joke, I’m lucky if I can read 1 book, previous kindles would only need charging once a month, this needs charging daily and getting worse.  The switch on button is at the bottom of the kindle, just where you hold it when reading, a really bad design fault.  Kindle have had so many good e readers, how have they now managed to get it so wrong.  I am really disappointed with this and feel massively let down."
B. Ellis,1.0 out of 5 stars,Terrible battery life & horrendous transferring books from my old kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 April 2019,"I am very disappointed in this item the battery runs down so quickly it's awful.  Transferring books from my old kindle is HORRENDOUS. I find the screen very hard to follow the first kindle I had was wonderful, when you turned on it went back to the last page you were reading. I don't know where I am with this one. I haven't had it long so hopefully things will improve but at the moment I don't like it."
Jinny B,4.0 out of 5 stars,A really light weight e reader,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2020,This is a replacement for my 4th generation Kindle. It is certainly light and easy to read. It's screen is slightly leass responsive than my old Kindle but the real problem I have is that it takes much longer to charge and holds its charge for a shorter time than the old one. I could go for weeks with the old one not needing to be recharged but this one needs recharging in 10 days. This is not a real problem over all but it is really noticeable when compared with the old one. I haven't tested its resistance to water and don't intend to deliberately submerge it but accidents can happen!
Kerrina,5.0 out of 5 stars,Extremely light to hold and brilliant for night reading,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 August 2020,"It was a bit smaller than I expected but once you’re into a good book that quickly becomes irrelevant.  I’m new to kindles. I’ve never had one before and this certainly doesn’t disappoint.  I absolutely love it and for reading in bed it a perfect for me with its backlight which means I can read for ages and it’s never tiring on the eyes.  I worried the battery was going down too quickly but actually thinking about how many hours I spend glued to it, it’s battery life is brilliant.  No forgetting it’s so easy and light to hold, no more hand ache from holding a book.I’m a convert!  How did I ever live without it?"
JRS,4.0 out of 5 stars,Accessing menu not always easy,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2020,"Basically good but I find accessing the menu difficult on occasions (it sometimes turns to the next page instead and it does not work from the review page). In addition, you have to go to the very last page in order for the book to be marked ""Read"".  I usually skip the previews of the next book for example but you have to go right to the review page at the very end before it gets marked as read. surely if you finish the ""main"" story (or stories)  the book should be considered as Read?"
Maire Masterson,1.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed with product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 October 2019,Really disappointed with this kindle. My old one was perfect but on/of button stopped working. Advised it couldn't be repaired . However after 3days it started working but I'd already returned the kindle paper white as disliked it so much. Couldn't change text into audio. Couldn't access chapters.Delighted my old one started working again .
Brenda Richardson,4.0 out of 5 stars,Customer service staffs knowledge disappointing.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 November 2019,So far I am happy with my Paper-white Kindle. It will take time to get used to the touch screen which I find extremely sensitive after the old kindle.However I also purchased a Kindle Fabric cover. This was shown on your web  site as being compatible with 10th generation products.It was therefore disappointing to find that it didn’t fit the  Paper-white. The cover measures 162x112 cm and the paper-white measures 167x116cm. I spoke to someone who advised they would send me out the correct one. The second one I received was exactly the same as the first one. No one I have spoken to seems to understand what I am saying to them perhaps you can let me know why the advertised cover does not fit and what covers are available to fit my new Kindle.
Teejay,3.0 out of 5 stars,Only 6GB storage not 8GB.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 February 2019,"Bought Kindle after my old mini iPad began to show signs of battery fatigue. For the first time ever right away I had buyer’s regret. The first surprise was that the usable storage space on the Kindle  was 6GB, not 8 GB. The operating system of what is arguably a unifunctiona device is a whole 2GB. Again, compared to the Apple Books reading experience, the Kindle is disappointing. Page turning doesn’t always work and unlike the iPad the screen doesn’t automatically switch to white on black when reading in bed. However, to be fair, the type is clearly legible and you can change it if desired to a “friendlier” font. The third disappointment was that the Kindle can’t be used as an eReader for ebooks from my local library even if they are in the ePub format."
j,4.0 out of 5 stars,Light & compact,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 July 2020,"I originally had a voyage till it died. Tried  the oasis but I found it heavy to hold (I have nerve damage), it wouldn’t fit my pocket, & ate battery if using light etc.  Defeats the point of having all the bells & whistles if Continuously charging it. Finally got this one & am happy with it. Lightweight & compact, straightforward to use. My only grouch so far is it is slower to wake up but I can live with that."
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 June 2020,"Previously I owned a kindle keyboard and still have a kindle fire. The keyboard broke and it's really hard to read on the fire, whilst sitting in the sun so I decided to invest in a new paperwhite.It's a great item. Perfect size, very light weight. Battery lasts longer if kept in aeroplane mode. I read for hours daily so battery doesn't last weeks like advertised but not an issue for me.I would give it 5 stars except I had a bad experience purchasing this from amazon and had to cancel my order to buy elsewhere."
Andrew Webb,1.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle downloaded library and collections deleted themselves. Customer support can't help,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2019,"I've used a Kindle Paperwhite for a few months now. This afternoon my device wiped itself of all downloaded eBooks and the collections that I'd organised them into. Customer support says the only option is to download and re-organise them again. That would probably take several hours, but I'm not keen to put that effort in as it might wipe itself again tomorrow. I now have extremely low confidence in this device, and am looking into alternatives.I'm also disturbed that customer support don't seem to be very interested in finding out exactly what caused this to happen on my device. You'd think this constitutes a fairly major bug, that presumably affects other users and will continue to do so in the future."
Bill Winward,5.0 out of 5 stars,"My 3rd Kindle, this one’s the best",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2020,"I have now had three Kindles, absolutely nothing wrong with any of them but I broke the screen of my second one. (dropped my Swiss Army  Knife on it!). I can’t remember what happened to the first. This one is the best. Very slightly narrower so fits in my hand better and the touchscreen is now smooth, the previous one felt rough. I don’t intend testing the waterproofing but I’m sure it will be OK if I were to have a read in the bath."
SarahFey,5.0 out of 5 stars,Loving it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2019,"Previously I had said I would never have a kindle because I love real books. However not enough shelf space made me start to wonder if a Kindle would be a good idea as I am always buying more books. I looked at the Kobo Aura H20 and was very tempted to get that as I liked the sound of the comfort light pro, a feature which is supposed to make it easier on your eyes and you can change the brightness and colour of the screen manually or the Kobo changes gradually to the time of day. I also liked that the back of the Kobo had a textured surface to provide better grip. I was slightly bothered by reviews of the Kindle which said the power button on the bottom was an issue and was easy to turn off accidently. In the end I decided to go with the Kindle as some of the books I want were only available on Kindle and I was told by several people that changing Kindle books to other formats is a pain. I received the Kindle as a gift for Christmas and I have to say I love it. I had an issue at first of the charging cable not seeming to fit, it took several attempts and I was about to give up when it eventually went in, perhaps some of them are just a bit tight when new, it has been fine since then. I have used it every day and the power button is no problem. The light is great for reading at night. I have the version with adverts but paid today to remove them, the adverts weren't a big issue for me but better without. The battery charge won't last me weeks as I have been using it more than the time Kindle/Amazon base their best battery life on, that doesn't bother me as so far it seems to last about a week which is fine by me. The Kindle won't replace physical books for me but it does make an excellent edition. The only thing I would change would be to add the same comfort light pro feature as the Kobo Aura H20, overall I am very happy and would recommend."
Sally A,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2021,"I love it!! It's perfect for on the go, or on the beach or carrying around in your bag. It's nice and light for one handed reading and I like the back light but I do wish you could change the tone to a warmer light like on the Oasis. I had the Oasis but I really didn't like it so got this instead and I'm much happier with it. I got a simple gel case with a popsocket on the back which works very well.  I do wish they did a bigger version as well but we can't have everything!"
Krista,5.0 out of 5 stars,my precious,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2019,"I've only ever had the very first edition of the Kindle and I literally cried when it stopped working (I eventually found out that my mum stepped on it, by accident she says, but can I trust her anymore?) so it took me a while to go out and buy a new Kindle without feeling like I'm betraying the old one, and I must say, it is delightful. Size and weight are comfortable, navigating is pretty easy, the battery lasts for weeks and I'm glad I got the 4G version as I can access the store wherever I am and run put of reading material :) so yeah, love it, will look after it and hope my mum gets nowhere near it."
Mrs. J. Dunne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Built in light so useful,especially if you like reading in bed!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 August 2019,"I’ve had one of the original Kindles, with the keyboard at the bottom, and was reluctant to change it. However, it started to go on  the blink so I persuaded my other half to buy me a new Kindle for my birthday and decided to go for the paper-white army two granddaughters have both got one. I’m absolutely delighted with it, it’s so light, easy to hold and change page. I’ve managed to organise my library which I didn’t think would be as easy as the old version but proved to be pretty simple. Would recommend it to anyone."
Leif,5.0 out of 5 stars,Probably would have bought the basic if it wasn’t on offer,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2020,"This replaced my old Paperwhite as after many years good service started to die. As a replacement it is pretty much the same, lightweight and easy to hold. The light again good for night time reading. The added Audible is a great addition. Would I buy it full price probably not I’d go for the other Paperwhite as to be honest comparing this with my sons new one they seem very similar. But as it was on offer I thought I’d treat myself. Let’s hope this lasts as many years as my other one did."
Maddie Walkden,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed compared to previous models...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 March 2019,"I am an addict. I devour books and have been a (begrudging) kindle convert since I first held one. I received the latest model (my third kindle) as a gift and have been disappointed. I enjoy the speed of the system compared to older models, however, I find the screen even at its lowest setting too bright at night (which is when all my reading is done) and I struggle with the book download system. For some reason I now have to ""deliver"" my purchases from a completely separate menu in account settings whereas previously they downloaded automatically... (and yes I have been through all menu settings).I prefer the new layout for settings and light adjustment and airplane mode but find it a little pointless when the books won't sync. Beware the battery too when you forget to turn off airplane mode- depletes far quicker than in older models, and have actually found that I need to charge this model far more often than the older one..."
Luke,1.0 out of 5 stars,Its a great device but amazon is censoring the kindle platform,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2020,"I love my kindle a lot and have bought 2 more additional devices for family members.recently Amazon started to censor the content that was available, so books I have previously purchased have been removed from the kindle platform without any notice.the books that are being removed are still available on the Rakuten kobo platform so I will be switching.Its a great device, but you haveto be willing to buy into a platform that may one day remove the books that you enjoyed without notice and be prepared to live with censorship."
George,4.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent quality versus value Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 December 2019,"This was my first Kindle having used a tablet and mobile phone with the Kindle app extensively. I like the long battery life and simplicity of opening the Kindle cover and going straight to your reading place. The device is also light and compact making it easy to carry. The screen is easy to read but slightly less responsive than my tablet when calling up the menu, although turning pages is easy. Book capacity seems fine for my needs and setting up wi-fi easy."
Mr. Graham Kerr,4.0 out of 5 stars,improvement?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 September 2019,"replaced an earlier generation kindle (non-paperwhite) whose screen had been damaged while in a bag.The new one - well it has a sharper screen and it obviously has a backlight so you can read when the lights are out - this is good. The integration of Audible is good too. My own preference, and this might change, was for the buttons at the side of my old one to change pages with rather than the touchscreen, but as i say this could change.The most annoying thing is the power button on the bottom. I think it is less ""recessed"" than the last one -  but i seem to catch it with my little finger when i am holding the kindle in my right hand. this results in me turning the kindle off a few times a chapter - which is as annoying as it sounds!"
StarrySkies,1.0 out of 5 stars,Total waste of money as it won't download any books.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2019,"I dislocated me this new kindle, my old one was better. It stopped downloading any books that I bought, amazon said upgrade the firmware which I did and it download two books which the support team sent to my kindle earlier today but now it won't download a book I bought and the book doesn't show in my cloud library so I can't download it without asking amazon kindle support to do it. I've only had it three weeks."
Georgina,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great gift idea and perfect for travellers and quick readers,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 June 2020,"This was bought as a gift for my grandma who hated packing multiple books because she travels a lot and reads quickly! This allowed her to free up space in her luggage and is very lightweight too! She loved this gift idea and has no complaints over the display and brightness, and thinks this is an ideal product for reading lovers! She even tried to convince me to buy one for myself (but I love real pages too much or I would!)"
M. Way,5.0 out of 5 stars,Enjoying my new kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 January 2021,like the back light and ability to change to a dark background with white writing.  Touch screen much easier to change page etc.  Had some initial problems registering the device so had to go to Amazon support chat to get it sorted (they deregistered it then re-registered it) so I could then sync my library.  They resolved this quite quickly for me which I was grateful for as it had taken me round and round in circles.
John Brewer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Needs to be a cheaper price!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 April 2019,"Needed as my last Kindle paperwhite was dying.  Not much difference, but can have black background for night viewing which doesn't disturb partners, which is a plus.  Transferred my library, but I still had to download from library to new kindle downloads individually - or maybe I'm not clever or young enough (70!) to understand a quicker route.  Kindle is a great product which I've used since they came out, but it's time they updated them and reduced the prices.  Seems easier to navigate Kindle app and books on my iPad, but not as lightweight.  This Kindle bought as a present for 70th birthday - would have been an Oasis, if they were £100 cheaper!"
Big Bri,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 January 2021,"I've had my original Kindle for many years, but it was starting to ghost so time for an upgrade.This paperwhite is brilliant. So much clearer, easier to read (don't need the glasses now) and makes me think I should have swapped long ago.Can not recommend this enough.Pair it with a fake leather cover and it's even better, and easier to hold and offers protection when away from home."
David Gurney,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product - very pleased with it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 August 2019,"Wanted to reduce the bulk in my home and take reading material with me more easily. This product has knocked the nail on the head. It's small and light, the display is high quality. Besides that, books are generally cheaper in Kindle format, plus there's plenty of sales on for Kindle books.I'm also dyslexic but the open dyslexic font is fantastic and helps me to read a bit faster. I'm not sure on battery life yet, as I've charged it once since I've had it but it's still floating around 60% with the backlight on 4 at all times. I'm really pleased with the product and it's come a long way since I bought a Kindle for my mum many years ago."
Chris L,2.0 out of 5 stars,Okay for Regular Books,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2020,"I’m sure Kindle Paperwhite is good for those that read regular books, however my purpose was more for technical and language books.  A couple of books I wanted to use Kindle for automatically gave an error advising it was not in the correct format for Kindle.  It is good to handle and to read novels etc.  I was expecting it to be better than using the Kindle App on other devices, but I found out that I prefer the app over the Kindle.  Not a bad product but I expected more for the large price tag.  It is kind of slow to respond to touch but again, it serves its purpose as a book reader."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,You may need more than one.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2019,"I bought it for my daughter who's doing her A levels, as the amount of books she needs is ridiculous, she's going to put her back out her bag is that heavy. The thing is she's never used it, and that because my young son won't put it down. He's only 9 but he hasn't stopped reading since Christmas. I'm made up he's taking up reading but it looks like I'll have to buy him one. I think I'll wait until they have another deal on.I love the feel of books, and a Kindle never interested me. I have good eyes and I was worried that looking at a screen would damage them, but the print in the kindle looks like a book, I was well impressed."
k H,5.0 out of 5 stars,Making reading enjoyable again!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 July 2020,"This was my first kindle so I was both excited and a little nervous. The blue colour was a hit with both myself and my son. It turned up with charge ready to go so I was able to download a book and start getting to grips with reading.The ability to adjust the text size is a great help as it's given me the joy of reading back that failing eyesight has taken the last few years. The back light also aids in making text a lot clearer.The kindle itself is a good solid weight to hold so it doesn't feel flimsy but it is not heavy. I was not keen on the idea of an ereader originally as I'm an old fashioned reader, preferring the feel of a book but this is approximately book sized and the scroll to turn page all helps you  feel like are still getting the authentic feel.Overall I recommend this kindle. I have thoroughly enjoyed it so far and I'm already planning my next read!!"
AH,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 April 2020,"Dint work outside away from WiFi, also wouldn't switch on or off, thought it was a  con to have to pay for prime to get free books, and the  Audio book subscription and on top of both of those you have to pay for the Audio book... No its okay thanks.... Im not that in love with Kindle to pay all that money out."
TamaraV88,5.0 out of 5 stars,Any book lover needs one,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 April 2020,"I really wish I had bought one sooner! I have read so many books since purchasing this, a new book instantly at your fingertips any time of day or night, it's lightweight, easy to read in any lighting, the battery lasts well. It's easy to set up and use, and very practical. Not to mention how much money and space I've saved on books! I do slightly miss physical books, but this is the way forward."
Hailey Adams,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a device!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 November 2018,"I would have never thought of buying one of these until i starting reading more books on my phone. My mom the other night suggested that I look a getting one of these as it could help with my eyes.I love my new paper white. It arrived really quick and to my surprise when I first loaded my device up it didn't take long to start up. Also when I first connected to the internet, the kindle was already logged in to my account. It was great as I could then start reading right away. I later found out that it was already logged in because I purchased it from the amazon app. Don't know how it worked out straight away that it was me, but I was just really happy to have it.My favourite series so far is A SHADE OF VAMPIRE. OMG I'm on book 2 already and I'm loving it.HAPPY READING IF YOU GET ONE!!HAILS XOXO"
Kindle Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Slightly irritating, but still a very functional e-book reader.",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 November 2019,"Nice and light, although the official kindle case has a rather sharp edge to the lid. I don't like the compulsory adverts for books that I have absolutely no interest in, which appear every time I open it, and am aggrieved that it would cost me £10 to get this irritating feature removed. The touch screen seems slightly less sensitive than my previous Kindle which is not ideal, but only a marginal flaw. It is a shame that you can not add memory with an SD card like you can on a phone, but it is still a very neat e-book Reader, and probably the best around."
Betty Bealey,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 July 2020,"When my 2nd Kindle died I decided to go for the Paperwhite and now I rather wish I had not. I resent having to pay £10 to remove the adverts but actually the navigation system is poor. The reading experience is OK but trying to find a book is not simple. With the old Kindle I could turn a page with either hand, and easily find the next book to read,  so now I wish I had saved my money and bought the basic Kindle. (Screensaver just reverted to elegant print photo and I do like the reading experience - 0h well)"
seekingsue,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thinner and more features,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 September 2020,"This was a replacement for my previous Kindle Paperwhite, which recently gave up the ghost. Registering and transferring my library was very easy, and I chose a model with more storage, as I am an avid reader. The new model is thinner, charges faster and has a longer battery life. As yet, I haven’t explored all the features! Pleased with my purchase, and look forward to taking it with me when we’re finally allowed to travel again!"
TonyF,4.0 out of 5 stars,Solutions to some of the problems with the new Kindle Paperwhite.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2019,"Like many others I also noted the same problems with the new Kindle. I came up with some solutions you might like to try solve the identified issues.1. When reading and holding the Kindle it is too easy to touch the protruding On/Off button  and switch it off- Solution:  is to change the orientation from portrait to landscape. The button is not easily accidentally pressed when reading in this format.2. Getting rid of the adverts - Solution: when you finish reading and want to switch off, hold the On/Off button down until a sub screen of options appears, go to ‘SCREEN OFF’ the bottom option and press that until the screen does go off. Close your case, if you have one, if not just leave it showing the blank screen. Then when you want to read again open the lid of your case and the Kindle will go direct to the page you left without the advert popping up.3. Battery Life. I also think when using actions in 2 above there is some improvement in the battery performance.Good LuckTony"
A,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Kindle is good, customer service is disgusting",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 June 2020,"Well where to start, the kindle took an extra week to arrive and I was not even notified of any delays. After multiple discussions with customer service (who are utterly awful) I was told “you will get the product soon”. No specification of what soon entailed. When the kindle finally arrived, the ads on it wouldn’t work. They displayed correctly but upon clicking them it would say the offer is unavailable. After contacting customer service once again I was told to reset my device, which didn’t work. I was then told I had to pay £10 for the ads to be removed, which would’ve been fine if I wanted them removed. I just wanted them to work properly but apparently paying to remove them was the “only way”. The customer service was just infuriating and horrid. The kindle is good though, highly recommend getting the without ads version as the screensaver looks really nice without ads."
Dylan Thomas,1.0 out of 5 stars,Only lasted a year,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 January 2021,"I like the Kindle, and it's great when travelling, also in lockdown when you know you can upload a book anytime.I bought one for my daughter December 2019 as a Christmas present. Unfortunately it broke early January 2021 and as it's just outside the 12 months, there is no recompense. So if you only expect your e-reader to last 12 months, that is fine, but personally I think it should last longer, and if it is faulty, an alternative offered.Poor service. Faulty item"
C Haines,5.0 out of 5 stars,Recommend if replacing 4th gen,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 October 2020,"Love this new Kindle. After breaking the screen on my Kindle 4 I initially bought a basic model as a replacement. Hated it and have now exchanged for Paperwhite. The backlight is great for my failing eyesight, it is lightweight and comfortable to hold. Could not get on with the touchscreen on basic but this one seems much better and I am no longer craving the buttons."
Owen  & Diana,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceeded expectations,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2020,"Very pleased with the Kindle Paperwhite .Being an avid reader over the years I was very sceptical about using something to read with rather than a book itself  .I was  completely wrong .The kindle is so versatile and easy to use the screen is very clear and totally adjustable,  fonts, brightness ect. It has even introduce me to audiobooks and my Bluetooth headphones connect seamlessly thus stopping others having to listen. I would recommend it heartily and the adjustable font would also make it useful to anyone who's eyesight might not be 100% ."
L. Richardson,5.0 out of 5 stars,A must have for avid readers,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 April 2019,"I had been using the kindle app on my tablet but l could only read it indoors but with my paperwhite l can now read anywhere. I have set the font style and size that suites me, also the brightness. Along with the case it is small, light and very convenient to use much lighter than a book I would highly recommend this product and it will be one of the first items l pack for holiday."
RoMO,4.0 out of 5 stars,Some good new features but the added front cover adverts are annoying.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 August 2020,This Kindle is much like my old Paperwhite.  I like the added waterproofing and the change of body colour....but don't like the adverts on the front nor the need to switch on then wait for the device to warm up before swiping to enter. I am surprised that a battery charge does not last as long as my old Paperwhite's did before it began to get old. I suspect that the adverts are the cause of this!
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 February 2020,"Bought on Black Friday 2019 for under £90.Really impressed with the battery life. I read during my commute 1.5 hours in total and the kindle easily lasts a week.The back light is great and doesn't hurt my eyes when reading for long (a couple of hours) periods of time.Although it's small and easy to hold it doesn't feel like you're straining to read, even on the smallest font setting.The only negative is the touch screen. It's responsive enough but sometimes doesn't know when you're trying to go back a page instead of forward or when you're trying to exit the book and not turn the page. This really isn't a big deal though as it does work fine most of the time."
Denise,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 October 2019,I have just upgraded from the original Kindle and the new version is lovely. Much smaller and lighter and the back light is fantastic.I like to read with my Kindle in my left hand and struggled to find out to turn the page with my left hand - the user guide was impossible to decipher so I looked it up online to learn that you can swipe and tap to turn the pages back & forth!The other issue is that its really easy to turn pages accidentally as the 'frame' is so thin. I don't have big hands so I imagine other people will have this issueBrilliant though and I'm able to take loads of books on holiday with me without sacrificing my shoes!!
elgordo,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not as good as my previous paperwhite.  Not happy.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 April 2019,"Stand alone this is probably a fine eBook reader.  But I can't help but compare it unfavourably to my previous model.To start with it has a somehow glossier and slippery finish and I have dropped it more in a month than the old one in a year.  The new screen is all very flash - going very close to the edge with out a ledge, but if you read one handed it is tricky to grip it and not turn pages accidentally.And as for switching on after a break.  Very slow.  Only a few seconds I know, but when you are used to it taking no time at all it soon becomes a complete pain.  As does the cheery wake up message.  Grrrr."
Veronica,4.0 out of 5 stars,Unrealistic battery life claim.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 December 2018,"Bought it from JohnLewis because Amazon werw going to make me wait until Feb 2019 for it! I bought it without audible as don't use that. On the whole I love it compared to old 2012 big and clunky one I was using with the side buttons. It's lighter and easier to hold for hands with arthritis and being able to gently swipe to turn the page is easy. The only gripe I have, is that you claim.the battery lasts for weeks not hours.  Lie! Not so. My old one lasted for a month on one charge. This one only lasted a week on a charge so you have grossly mis-sold and over estimated the battery life capacity. If it doesn't do it, then don't say it does."
Mrs. V. E. Hunt,5.0 out of 5 stars,New Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 April 2019,I am really pleased with this 10th generation kindle.  My old 5th generation one was filling up and not connecting to the internet.  Once I had registered this new one and connected to the wifi the transition of the old books to the new one went smoothly.  I also bought a Moko cover which wakes the kindle as you open it.  This kindle has lots more storage space.  I was alarmed that the kindle package was posted through the letterbox!  especially as we were in.  No one tried to ring the doorbell.  Luckily the package fell onto a mat.
Mr C. Walton.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Brilliant, a notable upgrade over the basic Kindle",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 December 2019,"This is a significant improvement over the basic Kindle.  The biggest change is the built in light, it adds light without fatiguing your eyes, and even a low brightness can make a huge difference when reading.  The next big selling point was the built in Audible support, now I can have it all on one device rather than switching between my phone for Audible and Kindle for reading.The Kindle Paperwhite is lightweight, easy to hold and just works."

Aj,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2021,"I love my kindle, the first one I purchased 5 years ago was dropped in the bath and stopped working, I purchased a replacement, move forward to the present time, I retrieved the old broken one from a drawer, Amazon paid me £40 for it and give me discount off my new kindle, a great buy for the pleasure it gives"
English Dave,4.0 out of 5 stars,Kindle number 3,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 December 2019,"This is the 3rd kindle I have bought over the years and is the best so far. The previous kindles were all good until they started to age and battery charge duration reduced and the stability of the device started to reduce, needing resetting every few days. This new device down loads quicker and a great feature, I can listen to my audible library as well althoughprolonged blue tooth use does reduce battery life. all in all happy with the purchase."
Penny T.,1.0 out of 5 stars,impossible to set up !,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 August 2020,"you'll be sorry you asked ! - I have been literally driven to tears trying to get this working- I read the instruction book over and over, phoned my Library about loading their books, emailed the Council for help,and asked my Brother-in-law who can usually help with tech. No joy at all. How  I havn't thrown it out of the window I don't know. I bought it for my Birthday and as I can't get to my Library and have bitterly regretted the stress it has given me. My only options seem to be selling it, or paying  a computer expert . It seems only capable of buying books from Amazon- which I can not afford.Very disillusioned and very upset"
Anthony D,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Product failed, unacceptable customer care",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 September 2020,"Product failed after 9 months. Amazon replaced it but with a refurbished (i.e. used, second-hand) and not a new one. I didn’t find this acceptable and challenged Amazon about this and the terms of my guarantee. After some discussion with their representative Amazon’s attitude can be summarised as “tough, just be glad you’ve got another year’s guarantee”. Nice. To my mind if a product cannot be repaired under warranty it should be replaced on the same basis as it was originally bought. If I’d wanted a refurbished (secondhand) Kindle I would have bought one in the first place.Would I buy another Paperwhite? Definitely not. It’s not worth the money. I'll stick to the basic model whose screen resolution is the same as the first Kindle I owned and which gave me good service for many years, and which to my mind is perfectly fine. Also if that fails and you are treated like this by Amazon you’ve not spent more than you need to.My failed Paperwhite is now back with Amazon, 9 months use but not a mark on it. Based on my experience be aware that if your new Paperwhite fails after 1 month and they can get mine going again it could be yours...I have been a customer of Amazon for many years with no problems, but this experience makes me much more wary about what and whether I buy from them."
Fvanterp,4.0 out of 5 stars,Easy to Use and nice buy,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 January 2020,This was my first experience with an e-reader so did not know whta to expect. One I cgot used to the black and white screen and page refreshes it is quite a good tool for reading books. This definitely makes it easier to carry and read books in a compact digital form. Reading at any time of the day and even at night is great with the lighting settings.Slightly more expensive than I expected for an e-reader but it you love reading it is worth it.
Bruce Weir,2.0 out of 5 stars,Battery Life,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 July 2020,"Very disappointed in 2020 Kindle Paperlight. The battery is very short lived. This is the second I've had (sent the 1st one back) with the same battery problem. It has nothing to do with the backlight because I don't read at night. It is not the indexing - none of the reasons Amazon suggests.I bought the 2020 version because I wanted to have Audible, but I can't read any Audible book before the battery needs charging! While I listen I am worrying at the same time that the battery is about to conk out!Another thing. It is advertised as having 4G connectivity - it says so on the box it arrived in. But open up Settings/Device Info. on the device itself and what do I see - 3G!!!I've still got the 2013 Kindle Paperwhite which works wonderfully, even now. What has happened with the 2020 Paperlight - more complicated menu, paper thinness and lightness is preferable to a long lasting battery?"
Daniel,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 February 2019,"A bit slow at times but works great and the waterproof quality not to mention the 4G makes it a must if you're looking for an e-reader. Battery life isn't as good as on some of the other kindles considering most of the people won't be using 0 brightness and constantly turning on the airplane mode, but really impressive none the less."
Ann,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent Buy,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2020,"This was bought for me for Christmas and I am over the moon with it!.  Having previously had a kindle fire, which was great, as it was colour and you could access other games etc on it but it was very heavy to hold.The kindle paperwhite is definitely worth every penny as it is light to hold, easy to use and waterproof should you take it on your hols.  This was bought for me without the special offers and I would say this was definitely worth the extra money as you do not get any pop ups etc.Would highly recommend"
Peter,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great peice of kit,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 December 2018,"Got this after my old kindle passed away earlier this year. The form quite nice, with the light and text being of the usual standard I've come to expect from Amazon's devices. Build quality is good, water resistance (let's not lie and say this is ""waterproof"" now Amazon - it's splashproof) seems to be up to scratch and response times are great.Niggles:Lack of buttons. I don't like that this is touchscreen. Getting to the home screen is a little fiddly, requiring you to press in just the right place on the screen. Page turns can be a bit of a faff if you're holding the item with your left hand. Maybe I'm just old school but I'm a firm believer that buttons beat touchscreen hands down for usability with EBooks. I'm not paying another £100 for them though - that's just ridiculous. Admittedly, the touchscreen does make it easier to type, but as I don't tend to buy through the Kindle or search very often, and tend to use the same wifi networks, this is a feature I very rarely use.Cases - realistically you're looking at laying out at least £30. Which is a shame - Had it been £10-20 I'dve not hesitated.--Don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic product, but the lack of buttons annoys me enough for me to give it only 4 stars."
Beano,2.0 out of 5 stars,Irritating shut down,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 February 2020,"My previous Kindle's was great but the battery died so I bought this one based on reviews and price but I have to say you probably do get what you pay for. This Kindle Paper White has a really irritating habit of shutting itself down while your reading - when it manages to sort itself out, usually after 10 - 15 minutes it takes you back to where you were in the book the last time you manually closed it down - as a result you have to spend a further 10 minutes trying to find where are up too - it just wastes so much reading time."
Willlm,1.0 out of 5 stars,How do I return a faulty product?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 October 2019,Am a big fan of kindle normally and recently bought another but it seems to have a mind of its own and turns the page occasionally randomly when fingers are on the frame - definitely not touching the screen!!Have tried to see where I can contact someone about it but can't find it anywhere hence this review - just want someone to contact me and arrange a replacement please.the 1 star will be chaged to 5 stars as soon as I can get the problem rectified
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,How is this rated 4.5 stars?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2019,"It's an OK product but that's it.The free app is much better than this £100+ product, as you can do colour highlighting, constant internet connection, the page turns are smoother, it's easier to type (when searching), and so on.The page turning can be frustrating if there's text highlighted (when I try and click next page, it will just re-select what's highlighted). The same goes with bringing down the menu at the top - buttons would've been better than a touch screen that only works when nearby words aren't highlighted.Then there are the ads. I know there is a 'without special offers' Kindle (but I had no idea what that was until I bought this - they should be accurate and call it 'without ads'), but why on Earth should I pay MORE MONEY on a £110 product to remove their stupid advertisements?The audacity of Amazon to force advertisements on a product that costs £110, and offer to remove them for a further £10!The book reader does what it says. Apart from the above gripes I'd say it's OK. Apart from the larger screen, this is worse than the Kindle App."
Heidi Shepherd,5.0 out of 5 stars,Rekindled my love of books,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 July 2019,"I bought the Kindle Paperwhite after my first generation Kindle which I've had for over 10 years stopped working. I absolutely love my new Kindle, it's lightweight but robust, it's really easy to use but has a range of great features, it's got excellent storage capabilities and the battery lasts for ages before you have to recharge. It's well worth spending the extra money to buy the free 4G version. I also love that I can download journals and save them on my Kindle as pdf's. Brilliant product!"
Jane,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I have become addicted to reading again, well worth every penny!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 September 2019,"I absolutely love this kindle.  I had no idea what a difference it would make to my life (honestly) and I was a real lover of the physical book.  The main advantages for me are (1) the anti glare light is brilliant for reading in bed (doesn't disturb my partner), and outside on a sunny day.  It's easy to hold and move pages with one hand, so reading in bed is just great.  (2) The kindle with it's recommendations, kindle unlimited and audiobook facilities is encouraging me to read much more, and this is what I'd set out to do, having unfortunately got out of the habit of reading."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A brilliant, efficient service - Thank you!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 November 2019,"My 2nd Kindle was stolen in Porto - panic because I was halfway through a book and I din'd.t want anyone to be able to access my Amazon/Kindle accounts.  The problem was rapidly resolved by my son-in-law and I received a new Kindle shortly after getting home.  Excellent instructions on how to use the device, all my library there - amazing.  And my accounts were not hacked!The device is excellent simple to use, good back-lighting etc.  Just one point - NOT easy to find the reading progress thing, which I like to use.Many thanks for such a brilliant service."
Mark P,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy one. You won't regret it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 December 2018,"After much soul searching I decided to replace my aged kindle touch with this supurb new kindle. I admit getting it on offer at the reduced price for £89.99 certainly helped!I'm glad I did, it's brilliant. It's compact slim design is light weight and easy to handle, and the new back lite screen is simply a joy. It's easy to read both daylight and in the dark, as well as in the bath!The user interface is easy to navigate around and much faster than my older kindle. It's not hard to get used to.I'm glad I upgraded, if your thinking about getting your first kindle or upgrading your old one, you won't regret it!"
Mrs K L Wraith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2021,"I was unsure as to whether to bother replacing my still working 10 year old kindle, the main benefits were a back light, more capacity and the ability to once again read in the bath which I’ve really missed with the non- waterproof version. I’m really glad I did. Same immense battery power, love the waterproof version and the backlight makes reading so much easier and more pleasant on an evening. Definitely a great purchase."
Tish smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with it :),Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 December 2019,Bought to replace my trusty kindle six that sadly gave up working after many years hard labour. I wanted a kindle just for reading this time because previous if the children have had an issue trusty kindle six was given as a stop gap.It took a little adjusting too as they layout it different not much really but enough it threw me off for a few hours. I love the fact I can bathe and read without fear. It’s supper light weight and so far no issues. :) very happy with my Christmas gift from my children ❤️
SMcC,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love this Kindle!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 August 2019,"My older Kindle paperweight started to not hold power, so a replacement was required! Love the smooth screen and brightness/fonts/touchscreen and comfort for holding, as before are all good. I bought a lovely cover for it too. Like the ability to read whilst floating in a pool or sat by the waters edge on holiday without worrying if it fell in. Had to download my books from the cloud again - No great hassle and I could then continue reading the book I was desperate to get back into!"

Chris Shaw,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 January 2020,"Great product, swapped over from a very old Kobo, so very refreshing to use. No issues at all with functionality of the product, quick and accurate. Only 4 stars as when starting it shows Kindle book adverts every time, which is not clear in the description. Got in touch with customer services who are able to remove this, but it should be made clearer in the advert. There is a cost to remove,£10 one off payment, but this was done for free for me."
Patricia,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Now I can read anywhere, any time!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 5 February 2020,"Bought for my birthday to replace original. Now can read at night when I have difficulty sleeping. Relatively light and touch screen works well. Recently bought Bluetooth headphones so that I can listen to audio books if my eyes are too tired for reading. Simple to connect. The light can be adjusted which is great also. Another great feature for me is that it is waterproof as I do like to read in the bath and no longer have to worry about dropping it. A little pricy, considering the price of tablets, but I love it."
mark,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best way to read,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 September 2020,"I love my Kindle paperwhite I forgot how much I needed the e-ink feature, I had the previous generation and unfortunately it fell foul of a water bottle leak and I was very upset. And while waiting to be able to replace it I got less than half of my normal reading done because of using a tablet, Thankfully this wonderful upgrade is waterproof too so I should never have the same thing happen again."
Isobel Pinsent,4.0 out of 5 stars,Would have given it 5s BUT...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 January 2020,"Generally I am very pleased with it - it is small portable and I can read the display outside BUT I have been a very long term subscriber to the Times and Sunday Times and I should be able to read the papers on this unit. I have tried a sample of the newspapers and it works well. However Amazon are quite prepared to sell me a new additional subscription but are very unhelpful when it comes to how I can make use of my current subscription. I have been very busy so have not had a chance to follow this up but, disappointingly, Amazon said they would get back to me and have not. I will either have to accept that I can read it on my phone or tablet only or spend time pressing Amazon and the Times to find a cure."

Mrs Rose,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great device - better for lefties.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 December 2018,"I have had 2 previous Kindles over the years, including the previous Paperwhite. I love this new device, it's light and easy to use. It is easier to use than previous models for a left handed person - the touch screen is divided differently making turning the page easier with your left hand. I've not tried the waterproof feature yet....Other than this to be honest I saw very little difference between my old and new paperwhites. If this is your first paperwhite then go for it - if you already have an older one and are hoping for lots of new features I'd leave it for now."
Kindler,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent e-reader,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 December 2019,I’ve had my first paper white for seven years and although it is still working it is getting slow so thought I would replace it in the Black Friday sale. I’m very happy with my new one. Although it’s slightly different I soon became accustomed to it. All my collections were transferred so I didn’t have to sort anything out. I’m more than happy with my purchase being a fan of kindle right from the first one I bought in 2010. Highly recommended.
silvester555,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Reader,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 January 2020,"As a replacement for a first gen Kindle, this is a great improvement in many ways. The automatic dictionary, the backlight, etc.  I'm still learning how to use the touchscreen to avoid selecting menus etc. The quality of the text is also better, and with the backlight, easier to read. Not tested for waterproofness or battery life yet!  I'm also trying out if I can use the device one handed, but that, I guess will take a little time..."
M. James,3.0 out of 5 stars,Missing my Kindle Keyboard,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 July 2019,"Had to buy a new kindle after my wonderful Keyboard finally died. If I had a choice I wouldn't have given it up for a couple of good reasons. For one I don't want a cover so the slide on off button was a winner, just pulled my replacement out of my bag to find the battery is flat and I am guessing its because the on button which is very easy to engage has been pressed keeping the kindle on. Another is I am left handed, so having to hold with my right hand so I can turn the page is disappointing. The push buttons on either side of the keyboard meant it didn't matter what hand you held the reader with you could go forward or backwards as you wished without swapping hands. The good points is the display is crisp. Struggling to get used to the new layout and why it returns back to main screen instead of the book list, and why you have to guess which part of the screen to press to return. However it is smaller and it is lighter and I clearly still missing my keyboard.  So if I was to change this,I  would be to bring the side buttons back and a home button which stays visible. Would also make the power button a bit more travel friendly."
Cornishcruiser,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice bit of kit....,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 May 2019,"For the past few years, I’d thought ‘No, can’t see me getting one of them..........’ , the main reason being that I like books, real books. But, after searching for books to buy on Amazon, I’d constantly see the huge difference in price between real books and kindle books. Some are even free. I nearly made the mistake of using my iPad to view kindle books - don’t ! I got the Kindle paper white and it’s brilliant. Small, light in weight, got a good cover for it, easy to use, battery lasts weeks. Very pleased with it."
Jack Cutting,2.0 out of 5 stars,Understand what 'With Special Offers' and 'Without Special Offers' mean before you buy,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 August 2020,"The Kindle itself is great! Books are small enough that 8GB of storage is plenty if you're not a full on bookworm with a massive library.The downfall is, the default option when purchasing the Kindle is to get it 'With Special Offers', but I couldn't see where it actually explained what this means, apart from a £10 discount. I assumed it meant that there was a special offer on at the time of purchase which gave me £10 off, and I could also choose to not get this discount (for some bizarre reasons). That is, sadly, not what this means at all! 'With Special Offers' means that Amazon will send advertisements to your Kindle, sometime when you are actually reading your book at the bottom. This can be very distracting, and certainly not worth the £10 discount which is applied. The advertisements are also shown on the lock screen.I wish I could go back and decide to select the option to not have ads on my Kindle, but alas I am after the returns window and have only just realised why there have been ads on there this whole time."
Constance,4.0 out of 5 stars,"I really like it, but.........",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2019,"I really like the Kindle now that I have found out how to use it.  But why on earth can't Amazon include some simple instructions with it.  There is a tiny publication that comes with it which is printed in many languages, needs a magnifying glass to read it, and tells me nothing the I really need to know.  Ok, I have now found some instructions online, but I still think a leaflet with the basics could, and should be included.  So sorry to have to drop one star for this omission."
jane markham,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Packed full of features, a readers delight!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 May 2019,"Love my new Paperwhite Kindle. Lightweight, easy to use [though I am still a novice], great choice of books to read from fiction/non fiction, fantasy, thriller.... Had a problem with some book purchases not showing in my 'library', but this was sorted out with me sending my number to the helpline and getting an immediate telephone call back. Everything was rectified by a professional, friendly and very competent customer service person within a few minutes or so. Great product and fantastic customer service."

DC,2.0 out of 5 stars,Screen Failed.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 October 2020,"Bought to replace my current Kindle which has given good service for a few years but battery now getting tired.Touch screen on this one failed after a couple of weeks use.Kindle started changing page randomly - which is very annoying.Also, would not react to touch - e.g. going to home screen, accessing dictionary etc.Restarted the Kindle twice to see if that would solve the problem. It didn't - and it is being returned for a refund.Glad I kept the old Kindle!"
RT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Better than a paper book,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 August 2019,"Too a long time to bite the bullet and get a kindle.  In hindsight I’m not sure what the hesitancy was - did I really prefer a real book?  Now think the kindle is actually BETTER thank a real book.  Light. Easy to take several books everywhere. Battery is great. Screen quality superb. And with water resistance there is no nervousness reading around the pool etc. Comfortable to hold. Good range of options from font size, typeface, brightness etc that you can adjust.  Very very good"
Mike 85,5.0 out of 5 stars,First time kindle buyer - lightimg and font choices available on your selected kindle.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 July 2020,"kindle paperwhite 32 gb was my choice.  It was a good buy!.  You do need to persevere with logging on to an existing Amazon account or starting a new account. Connecting to WIFI is  straight-forward.  On the frame an on/off button and USB cable port. Everything else is menu driven by touch selection. For myself I found the variable lighting and font  sizes a real benefit as due to poor eyesight I have difficulty in reading the average printed page. Two criticisms for Amazon: Whilst the delivery was well on time the actual packaging was appalling!. It was  a minimal wrap round cardboard  box, both ends open with no seal.  Fortunately the Kimdle was well packaged and survived delivery/ Also  I so not want the Amazon adverts draining the battery. Take these off and I will consider buying a case, screen protector and bluetooth libraary.  As I started - a good buy. Over to ypu Amazon"
George Kaplan,4.0 out of 5 stars,right direction,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2020,"The paperwhite is constantly improving. Reading in the dark now better than ever, the letters are pinning clear and sharp, access to a white range of books and long lasting battery to read without the need of recharging for much longer time.However, the screen is to small for those who need reading glasses and want enough words on one page. 8"" would be perfect and I was missing the headphone jack. Im not a big fan of Bluetooth."
Toomas Ormisson,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Mixed feelings: solid hardware, poor software",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 May 2020,"My experience:Started off with the device defaulting me to US locale and showing me no Audible content, since all my purchases are through Amazon UK. I imagine if I had any digital book purchases those would have been unavailable as well.The support request initiated from the Kindle got no response, or if it did it was lost somewhere.Although the device doesn't have ""advertisements"", it's trying to sell me everyting on every step I take on it. I'm not getting anything I didn't go looking for. Please stop that intrusive behaviour on your devices - I am not a product.The Goodreads integration is a nice feature! Though, getting external content to the device; like books purchased through Humble Bundle or other sites, is a hassle. I guess it's OK if Amazon is your only content provider.The customer support was really good once someone reached out to help!"
Mrs. C. M. Rogers,4.0 out of 5 stars,Replacing an original basic Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 August 2020,"Touch and feel are really nice, display is very good and it has a quality finish.  Only had it a few days and I'm  finding navigation and organising my library really perplexing and still haven't found my way round it particularly well.  Having to keep referring to the user guide but going in and out of that is quite annoying at times but I suspect it could be an 'age' thing or maybe its just me !Reasonably happy so far but I'm sure with time i'll be completely satisfied."
Terry a,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is a good E-reader,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 31 May 2020,"Delivered on time. Good price. I bought it to replace my 0ld and much ""Kindle Keyboard"".Absolutely no complaints about this reader at all.  SPECIAL OFFERS: I believe that this clever bit of free advertising was to be ""targeted"" base on my purchase record.. I have never bought a romance in my life, and yet most of the featured titles are just  that romance titles.  What a waste of a great marketing opportunity"
Jamie T,1.0 out of 5 stars,Poor quality control. Not worth hassle. Avoid.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 July 2020,Had two within space of two weeks.

Reverted back to using my 2014 Kindle. Avoid.
madlizzie,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Kindle yet,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 April 2020,"I ordered a new kindle during a lockdown as my last one was getting slower. I love this one as not only is it smaller but it has everything at your fingertips. With a couple of taps in the bottom left corner I can see how long left in the chapter, book etc. It changes page quicker, the quality of light is really good for reading at night and I wish I had upgraded sooner if I’m honest. Definitely worth the money."
cadi,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easy reading,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 September 2019,"This is a great improvement on the early Kindle I once had.  For reading text in any lighting condition it is lovely (better and easier on the eyes than a ""real"" book in bright light outside).  It doesn't handle illustrations and photographs very well - and although magazines can be downloaded it's not ideal for them.  In short - if it's just text and plain reading then I don't think there is anything better - I looked at all the other Kindles and am sure I made the right decision.  While the waterproof element was not a consideration for me at the time it is well worthwhile - I'm sure many of us have forgetfully left a paperback book we're in the middle of reading outside when it starts to drizzle - so it's a comfort to know that THIS Kindle can cope with it!"
stacey,5.0 out of 5 stars,It will make you happy,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 October 2020,"I love this paperwhite i really struggled to spend the extra as I've got 2 x kindle fires plus the first one with the buttons, well I went ahead and I'm so pleased it is very easy to use compared with my others.although I had used them for years, this is progress  and because it hasn't got all the games etc. i can really  concentrate on my reading. This will be invaluable if we have lockdown again ."
Keith,4.0 out of 5 stars,Adverts on this £120 device means it gets 1 star only 😠,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 January 2020,"Update: Amazon have been in touch and explained that the Special Offers refers to having a £10 discount in exchange for adverts. I was under the impression it was 'a' special offer with £10 off. It does say this on the webpage (I went back and checked) but by calling it Special Offers I think they're leaving it open to easy misinterpretation. CS have removed the ads from my device which was my biggest bug bear so I've upgraded my score to 4 stars as it's now as I expected but not quite as good as my old Kindle Voyage.Bought this Kindle as a replacement for my Voyage which I had for 5 years until it stopped working. Didn't want to be spending on a new one as I really liked the Voyage but needs must. The main annoyance with this Kindle is the ads on the lock screen, have never had these on my previous 2 kindles and find them quite annoying. What's the point of a power button if I then need to swipe the screen to open it due to adverts? Disappointed with this one, wish my Voyage still worked."
Faith,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2019,"I absolutely love my new Kindle Paperwhite! I'd been using my Kindle Fire for reading the last couple of months since I broke my Kindle e-reader and I could not get used to it, it was just too different. So my wonderful hubby gave me a new Paperwhite for Christmas. It is so wonderful! It's small, easy to hold but a good page size to read. I'm used to swiping to turn a page due to using my Fire for reading so that's ok. I just love it."
Daniel,5.0 out of 5 stars,From love/hate to purely Love,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 May 2019,"I've had an on and off relationship with kindle devices since the 4th Gen pre-touch devices which while revolutionary could be a bit of a clunky experience overall, a slightly lagged OS experience and other gripes meant I was often fluctuating between print books and the e-reader.Since deciding to punt for the new generation Kindle Paperwhite I'm no longer flitting between traditional and digital books. I'm now fully reading on the Kindle alone as it's just such a wonderful experience. The OS is far more responsive and with touch screen capability now, but the real revolution is the backlight. Finally night-time reading without the aid of a lamp or the 'big light' is a possibility and I'm surprised at just how much of a game changer it's been. The back of the device has a lovely tactile rubbery-texture which I think will aid with the grippiness of the device (however I've opted to pop it into the lovely fabric cover)Overall an excellent device, nice and compact and sturdy feeling and most importantly a real pleasure to look at."

I like how lightweight it is and it certainly seems to be easy to navigate.  I like the idea of a touchscreen, but seem to somehow jump 2 or 3 pages forward or backwards sometimes - not sure if this is me or a fault with the Kindle.Kindles are great in that you can be browsing for a good book to read and just seconds later you can be reading it.

petshopper,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 September 2020,A little difficult to hold in the sun as you sometimes it an area that changes the font or switches on another feature. When a book ends it could be easier to find the books you have already purchased. Says when the battery is low but then you need to recharge it. Needs to tell an hour before you need to recharge or tell you how much battery is left when you turn it on or off.

Everything from my old one down-loaded into my new one easily, but it was difficult to find everything compared with my old one.  I use a Kindle because of near-sight problems and need larger than normal print size.  The pages other than the actual books, which you can enlarge easily, are difficult for me to read. It would be better to have fewer illustrations and larger print. The swipe page turner is not as smooth as my iPad and I have to check that the page has actually turned or not turned two."

I enjoy reading and although I love the actual feel of paperback books and being able to hold them and refer back as and when I feel I would like to.  I cannot fault this item.  It is lightweight, easy to travel with and has a number of books awaiting reading all compacted into it.  I love it."
liblob,4.0 out of 5 stars,Good and bad features,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2019,"I bought the paperwhite to replace my old kindle because it is back lit and has a touch screen. However, despite those very welcome additions, I find many other features unnecessary and very irritating and not in the slightest intuitive. I paid the additional amount so as not to have advertising but find that the recommendations are, in effect, advertisements and an annoyance. I am perfectly capable of searching on line for authors I might like. My old kindle has a much better arrangement and works logically and I wish my paperwhite was the same.I love the  Kindle, especially when I am travelling, for its convenience, size and the ability to buy and download books anywhere but remain somewhat disappointed with this latest version."
Carlos De Sousa,4.0 out of 5 stars,Better in many aspects and worst in some others,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 January 2020,"I've been a kindle user for many years, this is my fourth Kindle (I often leave them behind in airplanes), the screen is certainly much improved from the previous generation, it's also lighter overall and the ability to connect headphones to listen to audible books is appreciated (although not really necessary). Unfortunately, it seems like the processor has been downgraded as it takes much longer to start up and wake up from standby, it also crashes often when one is reading a large PDF file with charts."
JAG,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great but has some annoying new features or loss of features,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 December 2018,"I struggle hard when having to review his type of product.  It is everything my last paperwhite was but as usual the developers and testers do not pay attention to detail.When you have collections selected you can no longer see any books not added to a collection and when adding books to collections you used to have a screen hat allowed you to add or remove from the same screen, this has now been made into two separate options which is in my opinion is a backward step.  My other observation is that Amazon will receive this feedback but never do anything with it, which does make feedback rather pointless and hey I have only scored. 3*"

Latenighter,4.0 out of 5 stars,Screen slightly less responsive than older versions?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 December 2018,"Looks pretty much like all the other Paperwhites but this one's screen seems  less responsive than my others have been.  Page-turning is fine, but sometimes on a dialogue box I've had to press several times to get a reaction.  My previous two Paperwhites developed a fault - most of the book titles disappeared  As it was such a particular fault I wondered if the second one caught it from the first through being synchronized, so I haven't synced this one with them or loaded any of my collections.  Hope it will last well, I can't imagine being without a kindle now."
Chloé Grunenwald,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fantastic e-reader!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 July 2020,"This e-reader has changed my life! I will admit that prior to having the Kindle, I was not much of an avid reader. I would read 1-2 books per year, usually while on holiday. I got this in October 2019 and have already 14 books! I have gotten it as a gift for two other people and recommended it to many more. Here are some of the features I love:- The screen looks like paper. If the backlight is on 0, there is absolutely no light and it really feels like looking at paper, not a screen.- The backlight has a scale of 0-24, so you can really adjust it to the level you'd like.- The battery life is really long. It usually lasts me more than one book.- It is lightweight and small, so you can take it anywhere (unlike some thick, hard copy books)- I live in Ukraine, so having access to English books can be tricky. With the Kindle, you can instantly download any book from the Amazon store.- You can highlight text and all your highlights are stored under the ""Notes"" tab. So, you can easily refer back to any highlighted text.- You can look up words in the dictionary (even without WiFi connection) and the Kindle automatically compiles a list of words you looked up. A great way to learn new vocabulary.- You can choose the font type, size, and spacing to whatever suits you best. There is even a ""dyslexia friendly"" font.Overall, a really great way to experience reading. I have nothing bad to say about it. I would highly recommend this Kindle, especially to anyone living abroad or anyone who is a reluctant reader."
Celia Higgs,5.0 out of 5 stars,As good as the old one,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 April 2019,My old one had broken ... the charging point had been pushed in. My new kindle is great... I fall asleep reading and when I can’t sleep the light is great to read from. You need a new cover as my old one didn’t fit... additional cost.  Putting it on charge I was slightly concerned that the connection is a tight fit . I hope I don’t end up pushing that in too.Only negative is that there are no longer the pictures on the screen... the pencils etc.  Now it just advertises books. This is disappointing....

I bought the kindle for my partner and I knew I would have the page home experience to select my type of reading to have a nice experience with my own kindle. I was expecting this page to have a kindle with my style as I was using his kindle for a while. So when I was going through the steps after selecting the language English from uk , it showed my home experience in Japanese. So all the options of books was in Japanese and I couldn't read a single thing. I have to skip the step. Looking to my whole thing is in Japanese. Than I reset the kindle to start it again and guess what my home experience disappeared. Now I can't select the type of books I read and my kindle is not pared with what a like. I am extremely Disappointed because I was waiting for this step. Not joking. I need to have this set up for my style of reading and now I am so upset and I want to return the kindle. There is no point not having a kindle with my personality. I can use my Fiancé one that I use sometimes."
Ballards,2.0 out of 5 stars,DONT BUY IF YOU THINK YOU ARE GETTING AUDIBLE BOOKS.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 January 2020,If you want audible then you have to subscribe £7.99 per month. Or purchase a book for say £9.99 and pay an extra. £9.99 for audible  so you could be paying double the cost of a book for audible! if you chose the single purchase option. I feel that this should be mentioned in the initial advert instead of being hidden in the ads attached.  I am keeping this as my old kindle has died on me. But not paying exorbitant price of the audible.  Disappointing amazon.
Mark Bramley,2.0 out of 5 stars,Headphones and Kindle Unlimited issues have spoilt the experience,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2020,"I was delighted to be buying a Kindle that would allow me to read, and listen to, books.  I mainly listen to audiobooks nowadays, but tend to fall asleep at night, so the prospect of being able to read the same book at night seamlessly was very appealing.The reality is somewhat difference.  The first audiobook I wanted to read as well isn't even available as a text book!  So, I thought I would use Kindle Unlimited (3 months free with the Kindle purchase) to find a new text / audio combo.  I gave up as searching by genre and by audio was not easy, and then when I finally chose some books, it turned out they were all chargeable.  So Kindle Limited actually!Then my earbuds won't pair easily with the Kindle.  Occasionally they do, but most times not.  Even if they do, if I then pause, it loses the connection again - and repeat.  Very frustrating.The same earbuds pair with other devices seamlessly.So, I am just debating whether to keep the Kindle for read only, or send back"

They need to take down the lowest brightness setting back to the last generation where I could actually fall asleep whilst reading this!  if they do that mixed with the new dark mode feature - this would be PERFECT!  Please listen to this request amazon - lot's of forums complain about this feature!
Karen Howard,4.0 out of 5 stars,As good as ever,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2020,This was a Christmas present to replace my aged paperwhite which would no longer automatically connect to wifi and which wouldn't remember my default device. This is is smaller and lighter with all the good features of a paperwhite.  Had a moment's scare when the battery seemed to drain almost overnight without being used and my screen froze but once I charged it up again it seemed to right itself and is now working fine.
Jill,3.0 out of 5 stars,Great piece of kit but.....,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2020,"This is my 2nd kindle & I love it BUT this new one is smaller than my first, exactly the same thing but does NOT fit snuggly into the proper leather holder I bought first time round. BEWARE IF YOU READ IN THE BATH, HOT TUB OR DON'T HAVE IT FIRMLY IN YOUR GRASP, IT WILL AND DOES DROP OUT OF THE CASE. I do not understand why and would appreciate if Amazon could explain this."
ami,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great way to read,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 December 2019,"I love the simplicity of buying and downloading books . I wish there is a special place to store titles of books read ,even if not bought from Amazon. Being able to alter the print and background is brilliant.I do find holding it difficult with arthritis the amazon case doesn't  really help much on that front and my fingers touch the screen and pages go haywire, some cases have a surround but I found that out afterwards. Maybe I need to invest in a flexible holder."

And in that respect it was excellent.But its a book library, so why is your library not easily accessible, it's NOT and it's ANNOYING.Touch screen, yes frequently resulting in a myriad of options, changes you had NOT wanted.Easy to hold, to be fare I had it in a cover, but it was as slippery as an eel.Overall it was as GOOD as it was ANNOYING, but I enjoyed my holiday."
GRG Cambridge,1.0 out of 5 stars,Dead After 12-Months!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 April 2020,"*DO NOT BUY*Worked great for a year, but then left it uncharged for 5-weeks. Result, dead battery. Apparently a common problem with Kindle Paperwhites. Just out of warranty, typical. Amazon's response is simply to offer a discount on a new purchase. What a waste of £120. Lobo will be my next e-reader."
Sharon Emery,5.0 out of 5 stars,Surprised & impressed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 July 2020,"I was adamant I would never read a book electronically but lack of library access has reduced me to the kindle. I am pleasantly surprised by it's lightness, (much easier than lugging a paperback which often means a bigger bag to carry it in), easier to read when eating as I can stand it up with the cover angled, my eyes don't get so tired so quickly. All in all am very impressed, although you have to be careful when selecting a book to read that it is actually free."

Peter,5.0 out of 5 stars,Be careful when buying case as different kindles vary in size,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 21 October 2020,"Bought it to replace Kindle that I purchased many year ago which continues to work very well with excellent battery life, but not backlit and is larger (with keyboard). Paperwhite is more compact and better to use in low lighting. Be careful when buying a case as there seem to be a good number of different models of kindles with different case sizes - the first one I bought was the wrong size."
Bill Robley,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's not a lawn mower.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 June 2019,"This is my first Kindle so have nothing to compare it against but, being on my second book, I'd have to say it does what it does very well.There's no unnecessary bells and whistles so it doesn't double as a torch or a toaster or an automatic dog walker.It's an E book, plain and simple.The battery life is quoted as weeks rather than days and, so it may be, IF you turn off the wi-fi and bluetooth.Am I pleased with it?Yup. It's perfectly good.Should you buy one?Well. That depends.If you want an E book with 8GB of memory. Go for it.If you want something to cut the grass... then no. No you shouldn't buy this."
peter coombes,3.0 out of 5 stars,Not there yet but almost,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 April 2019,It’s a very nice kindle but I did find it a bit slow and sometimes buggy on turning pages and getting into menus for books that sometimes did not work then jumped a lot of pages after it caught up but if this is sorted out with an update I think it’s a very good kindle it has a nice screen but a bit too small for me so I returned and got the oasis not from amazon but another shop that’s is very nice and seems to work faster but is it worth the extra for me the bigger screen is but maybe not for everyone
Jmax,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best one yet.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 March 2019,"Got this for my partner and she loves it. Upgraded from the paper white 3 years ago to this one and it’s faster, lighter and looks much better, it’s also nice the screen is flush with the bezel (boarder) as it feels so much better swiping the screen and not hitting your finger on the bezel. Nice to be water resistant too. Battery life is just as good too. Great upgrade."

T Rowley,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great replacement for reading on a smartphone!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 September 2020,"I had been reading on an iPhone using the Kindle app for many years. The Kindle Paperwhite is so much better; I wish I had bought one sooner. The screen is easy to read without tiring your eyes and the battery lasts for ages.Compared to reading on an iPhone, the light from the screen is much softer, so it disturbs my partner less than a smartphone on night mode.If I could find one fault, it’s that the screen looks delicate, so a case is a must if you plan on putting it in your backpack or luggage.Also, if you upload a large number of books when you get your kindle home then be prepared for it to freeze up for a night while it gets its act together. Keep it plugged in to a wall socket and try and be patient and all will be well. It’ll also be heavy on the battery while it indexes over the first day or two."
Gill Rice,3.0 out of 5 stars,Cannot use bluetooth,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 October 2019,I didn't want to order another Paperwhite (this is my 3rd). I sat on my first one (oops) but was very annoyed with Amazon when the charging port on my 2nd one stopped working.  I would have thought it could have been repaired but they said no I would have to replace it.  So reluctantly had to buy my 3rd Paperwhite.  All very well but yippee I can bluetooth my headphones and listen to my audiobooks on my Paperwhite - NO - it will not recognize my headphone (£250 worth).  So as you can imagine I am not in awe of my new Paperwhite which I think Amazon fooled me into buying
Jill Wales,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great. can read without a light,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2019,"I love this kindle. I have had my other one for many years and didn't really want to change it but, decided that the light would be a big advantage for camping or just reading outside in the evening and reading in bed in the middle of the night and don't want to put the light on to wake your partner.  I was not disappointed - it does exactly what it says, the light is enough to read by and it is lighter than my other one.  Really pleased with this kindle."
Louise M.,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beware of the AD version which is TEN pound cheaper.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 February 2020,"I like my Kindle. This order did not go well. I was offered a discount as a valued customer to replace my old one which had died. I did so but had not realised I had ticked the one with adverts. The lady and I were still ""chatting"" when I did so, so I probably did not pay as much attention as I usually do. When I got the new kindle adverts were appearing. I then contacted the chat line and they kindly agreed to remove this app. Two days later the adverts reappeared. I contacted the chat again. They offered to remove the adverts again and offered to repay the £10 pound fee. I explained that I had not paid £10 in the first place so did not want it refunding. I was then debited £10 for the removal of the ads. I thought ok....that's fair but really feel a bit put out especially when the paper white appeared a couple of days later at a much reduced rate."
Mrs. L. M. Oliver,5.0 out of 5 stars,Reading was never so easy!!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 January 2019,"I bought the paperwhite as an update to my previous basic kindle and was very pleased with the backlight, the ease of transfer of my existing kindle books and the way it sorts them for you.  It made my old kindle look so basic I wished I had upgraded years ago!  It isnt too heavy and the print is very clear as the font can be changed, the text enlarged etc to suit which is a boon for people with poor eyesight.  I am still learning about it but so far, am happy.  I havent tried its waterproof qualities but its good to know that it is waterproof should the need arise!  All in all, I am delighted with my purchase."
Deborah Monaghan,5.0 out of 5 stars,Couldn’t recommend more !!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 September 2020,I love it. However I don’t think the battery life is as states it would only apply if used very sparingly as I don’t it needs to be charged a lot more than weekly and I’m sure it advertised as even monthly. Nah not if you are avid reader as I am.However that said I lobe my new paper white it’s c my fourth and I’m not sure my last. Everything else about it is 5 🌟
Mr. J. Ian Press,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Very good, but a couple of cons",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 November 2018,"It is very good and compact, I welcome the extra memory I chose, and I got used to it quite quickly. I do find the contrast somewhat unsatisfactory, though manageable. Most disappointing, though I did suspect this before purchase, is that the Teach Yourself audio (touch and listen) enhanced language textbooks, advertised on Amazon for Kindle, only have the audio on an iPad (and presumably iPhone, Apple laptop and Apple desktop). I use my iPad. Ok, I knew, but that doesn’t stop this being unsatisfactory."
Noonerz,3.0 out of 5 stars,"Handy size, massive storage capacity",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 12 April 2019,"Great to use in all light conditions, handy and convenient size. Great for those with fading eyesight; with adjustable fonts, sizes, light levels, and massive storage capacity. I bought as my eyes are getting worse with age and I can now read far easier. The only problems I have with the Kindle is a clunky, terribly designed interface, designed for adults with children's hands or of course children - if this was made more intuitive, it could massively improve it. Though this shouldn't put you off a purchase - I am just being picky!"
B D Rogers,4.0 out of 5 stars,My Paperwhite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 October 2019,"This is my second Paperwhite, after I dropped the first it ended up with a blank area on the screen. I miss the raised face of my old one as my fingers often inadvertently touch the screen and I loose the page I'm reading. The most annoying thing is the on/off button its location at the bottom of the kindle is where I place the fingers of my right hand as I hold it to read. Without a doubt  I will have accidentally turned of my Kindle three times for every hour of use. This button location also causes a problem if I try to stand it upright when I use it travelling on a train or aeroplane fold down table. I don't use a cover and my well travelled Kindle has scuff marks on the black surround but I've yet to scratch the face. My kindle is my favourite possession and would love to have a better version of my Paperwhite."
Dr S P Deacon,3.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointed user,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2020,I had to replace my previous Kindle due to a screen fault just outside warranty.This replacement opens slower than my previous KindleAlthough only a few weeks old it has already frozen once and required rebootingI am having trouble saving downloaded books to existing collectionsAlso I had anticipated this model to have 3 and 4G capability but this is not installedHaving been a Kindle user for several years I am somewhat disappointed
dawn,3.0 out of 5 stars,Could not transport books from old kindle in their collection format,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 December 2019,"Call me naive, but I had imagined that I would be able to port all my book collections across from my trusty eight year old kindle to this paper white. Not only are the enclosed instructions brief to the point of useless, it wasn’t easy to access any google guidance which really helped with this. Accordingly I had to completely re file all the collections which had been assigned in one general pile onto this new one. It took me about ten hours.....yes, I have a lot of books but isn’t that the whole point of having a kindle and creating libraries of samples, classics, unread, cookery and so on?"
Fiona,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my new Paperwhite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 July 2020,"This is great , upgraded from my old Paperwhite that was getting a bit slow after quite a few years of daily use. I have the one with ads which is really no problem which I thought would be reading some reviews. It’s literally around 5 seconds and you swipe it away, not worth paying the extra £10 to have without.Would definitely recommend and wouldn’t be without it."
JFDIT,5.0 out of 5 stars,Significant Improvement over Previous Model,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 April 2019,"I have had most of the Kindle readers and am delighted to say this version is the best so far.  It is lighter, thinner and the case is so much better. Less bulky and just slicker.The screen light is better diffused than before, no bright spots at the bottom of the screen.  For me this is a very worthwhile upgrade.Only comment, which is in respect of the software, please bring the screen brightness control slider forward rather than having to navigate to it via settings."
K9 crazy,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good purchase,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 26 September 2020,"My husband is a prolific reader and during lockdown books have cost us a fortune! I finally persuaded him to try a kindle - and he loves it!! It would not replace 'real' books for all reading, but for one read paperbacks it is brilliant. We have also chosen Kindle Unlimited and the combination is brilliant and superb value.  Would recommend for all bookworms everywhere."
Mrs Livingstone,4.0 out of 5 stars,A bit disappointed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 March 2019,"I loved my 6th generation Kindle PaperWhite which I bought in 2013 and I was told that the latest edition was much better and so I decided to purchase a brand new one.  It's great, but I'm disappointed because I can't detect any improvement. It's much slower 'waking up' than my old one and I honestly don't think the charge lasts any longer - in fact without doing a check I'd guess that it's not quite as good.  I'm giving it four stars because it's a Kindle and I love using one to read my favourite books but I don't think it's any better than my six year old one."
Wendy Woo,5.0 out of 5 stars,Favourite new kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 August 2020,"Had to buy a new Kindle when I'd reached the maximum capacity of my original Kindle (with a keyboard format), this new 10th Generation style is so much smaller and lighter, although I do miss the side buttons to move back and forth through the book I'm reading, I'm still getting the hang of not hitting the screen whilst reading and finding myself on a totally new page!!  But in all honesty, I did have my original Kindle for almost 9yrs, so that might take a while, but I'm loving the fact I can read comics and magazines, read 'normal' books and listen to audio books all on a device the size of a smallish birthday card and it doesn't actually weigh a lot more than the card tbh, a very worthwhile purchase."
fen,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely thrilled,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 November 2018,"I have never used a Kindle before and I just love it.  It is sleek in its gorgeous red leather case, it is really slim to carry around in a handbag.  Plus, I have paired it with my iPhone, so if you are out and about and, for example, waiting for an appointment, you can access it on your iPhone via the Kindle app.  And for someone who is a bit of a technological dinosaur, it was relatively easy to set everything up.  The service was quick and efficient.  Really impressed all round.  My only slight bug bear was that not long after I bought it, it was £30 cheaper in the Black Friday deal!!"
English Roses,5.0 out of 5 stars,Paperwhite Kindle - Superb!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 August 2019,"I had been toying with the idea of getting a Kindle for months but, because I hadn’t been reading much, I thought it was a waste of time. I also love to touch hard copy books and see them sitting neatly in my bookshelves. Recently, I have had more time on m hands so I thought I would find something to read. I most wanted to read books I had read years ago but many were no longer in print. I bought some used paperbacks which were classed as “very good” condition but all three I ordered were badly yellowed which put me off. And so I bought a Kindle. I thought for sure I wouldn’t use it much and wouldn’t warm to it. Was I wrong! I have had it about three weeks now and I have been able to read many books that were out of print.Things I love:- instant purchase, instant read. No waiting for books to arrive even though it is usually only a day as a Prime member.- can read out of print books easily- easy to carry to read on the train- lovely adjustable brightness that can be altered any time- syncs with goodreads.com- great battery time between charges- I have gone from not reading fiction at all to being excited about what I shall find to read nextThings I don’t like:- the leather cover I purchased can be tiring on the hands if you read a lot as I now do.- do check that the charger fits securely. I had to return the first Kindle because the USB cable kept falling out"
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Sadly not impressed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 13 September 2020,"This is my first Kindle and I bought it to have access to foreign literature which I cannot buy in my town. I am a book lover and I knew a Kindle could not entirely replace books for me, however, I was happy with an adequate result.These are my thoughts:The print colour isn't dark enough, unless you increase the screen brightness, in which case you'll be dazzled by it;The screen is slightly too small, so for a fast reader this means turning page every few seconds, or having a tiny font size (not very comfortable);The touch screen is quite slow to respond, I was expecting it to be like an Ipad but it feels more like an old one.Overall, for my personal reading experience, Kindle isn't suitable. But if you enjoy to read a few lines here and there and technology encourages you, then go for it."
T-Barr,5.0 out of 5 stars,The upgrade you didn't even know you needed,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 January 2019,"I love my  old Kindle. I had the original model (without a keyboard) and I never considered upgrading to the paperwhite, until my wife bought me one for Christmas. The difference is fantastic. No more struggling to find the best light source, and yet it never feels like a bright screen or tablet. The simple tap of the screen on either side turns the page, which is just perfect. The new home screen and navigation UI is a huge improvement as well!Go on...treat yourself!"

Dr C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,My second paperwhite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 10 August 2020,"My previous paperwhite lasted 6+ years and would still be going strong had the electrical connection been more robust. The screen is so much better for sitting outdoors reading, than using a Fire or a computer to read documents. You can read books but also send work docs to your kindle address and take those with you to read anywhere too. This new kindle has an earphone port too, so I must try that sometime! These are more expensive than the Fire, and you can't watch movies... but buy a Fire for that, and use the Kindle for reading anywhere. It holds a very lot of books!"

M. S.,1.0 out of 5 stars,scam with 'special offers',Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2020,"Active adverts on the device, which you can't switch off if you don't pay, is a scam. This program prevent device to wake up immediately to continue reading and is forcing reader to do extra swipe and wait to load ads and then to load your book. Bought as a Christmas gift for teenager, really disappointed. Now paid £10 RANSOM to Amazon to unlock device. It is a shame that you have to pay extra to unlock full potential of the device. Bought Kobo Clara HD for another boy for similar price and had all features on start without paying for releasing the device. From a ethical point of view shame on you Amazon.  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN AND WILL DO EVERYTHING TO AVOID SHOPPING ON AMAZON JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT FAIR. I wash shopping on amazon over a decade but It is not about this £10 scam, it is personal now.

Representative said it's usually unbreakable (hence my did?) and unrepairable.If only Amazon wouldn't make billions I would take this one neatly, but offering only 1-year device guarantee, ridiculous 15% for a new kindle that should replace UNBREAKABLE one?NO thanks, Jeff."

Had one years ago which the battery gave up on and then decided to read using the kindle app instead. Transitioned back to a physical kindle 2 months ago and although it took some time to get used to it (holding a larger item and the page not turning as quickly) I know love it and use it all the time.I have also bought the amazon cover in yellow for it which is amazing as the kindle auto turns on and off when you open and close the cover.
Cymru am Byth,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great e reader,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 19 July 2019,"Having had a more expensive kindle Voyager for a few year. It broke. So I replaced it with this e reader. I must say for a fraction of the price of the voyager this e reader is no different when using than the more expensive one. The only difference is that it does not have adaptive lighting, and buttons on the side for page turning. But for a significant difference in price I don’t mind adjusting the light myself and I always swiped to change pages anyway. Great value"
Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,"A bit pricey for what it is, returned for the basic model!",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 July 2019,"Altough it is waterproof and had more storage, I don't feel you get a lot more for your money with the kindle paperwhite compared the new basic kindle. It may be that you feel you need it to be waterproof (say you like to read in the bath), but for me I felt I was paying a premium for features that I wouldn't really need. I replaced it with the basic kindle and it is perfect!Nice ereader though, but I feel you get a similar experience with the other kindle."

WOW!, glad I did that, it is lighter cheaper and more comfortable than the older Paperwhites,and I liked them, it is slightly smaller, AND came with a screen protector which I applied with no problems. I also bought a cover for it, you need to check that the covers fit the 2018 version (10th generation). Have had this for a couple of days now and enjoying it . It also fits in the rear pocket of my jeans even with the cover on...........unlike the Oasis!!overall , the best kindle out there..............trust me"

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Slow delivery,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 September 2020,"This was a replacement for my 5 year old kindle paper white which was struggling to recharge. Very similar to the original, I like the fact that it is waterproof as I like to read in the hot tub (hopefully this won’t be tested) downloading my existing library was very easy thanks to Amazons system. After reading other reviews I paid extra to have no special offers. I don’t know if this was worthwhile as I don’t know how intrusive the advertisements would be. However not having special offers meant having to wait considerably longer for delivery and the device was only available in black. Not sure why this should be. Perhaps a better description of what “ special offers “ entails would be helpful."
Roger Snook,4.0 out of 5 stars,A Curate's egg,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 June 2020,"I bought this to replace my old manual keyboard Kindle, more to benefit from the backlighting than any of its other features.Is it an improvement? Yes and no.I like the backlighting and the fact that it is a bit lighter than my old kindle.I dislike the touchscreen, but then I find all touchscreens a nuisance as my fingers are too big to operate them with any success. Hence I also regret the loss of the keyboard.I miss the page advance and return buttons, which allowed one to read the Kindle one handed.I am aggravated that Amazon now insist that the Kindle has to be registered via Wifi, which I cannot access with any convenience.However, overall the one function which motivated my purchase, the backlighting, works well and the other inconveniences I can put up with. Just a pity the old keyboard version could not be supplied with backlighting."
W. Sutherland,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great reader let down slightly by interface.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 January 2020,"Like my new Kindle. Had the original keyboard version and was sad to see it go once it packed up. I like the way the new Kindle fits into my hand, I also like the lighting. Not 100% on the interface and I feel strangely that the kindle app on other devices is more intuitive and is more flexible and why this version should have less features feels odd.However as a reader it is great."
Gabriel,1.0 out of 5 stars,Battery problem,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2021,"This is was my third kindle. I bought it in Feb 2019 as a replacement for the one that I've lost. Light, touch and connectivity to WIFI is find, nothing to complain.The main problem is with its battery. It doesn't last as much as its predecessors and it if you're NOT using it it keeps discharging until it's completely dead.  I've managed to power it up for several times, but the last time after 2 years and 1 months since I bought it, it doesn't power up.Since warranty lasts only 1 year, Amazon gave me 15% off for a new kindle. There's no option to repair it or trade it back for a new or refurbished one. It feels such a waste .I'm not really satisfied with a 2 years lifetime for a product that I haven't used that much.Overall rating : 1 start"
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,4th edition adds bluetooth audio,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 June 2020,"This is now the 3rd kindle i've owned in total, from an original, to a paperwhite 2e, to now the paperwhite 4e. You know exactly what you're getting, they all work pretty much the same; However, the new edition has added a high (300) dpi screen and bluetooth audio for audible books or read as text-to-speech. Bear in mind slightly smaller than paperwhite 1e-3e so old cases will not fit."
The Engineer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Should Have Got One Years Ago,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 April 2019,"Wow, love the kindle. I don't think I will go back to reading real books again. No awkward holding of the book, bending the spine and turning pages. Oh, and best of all you can check what any word means at the touch of the screen.The only downside is the books cost more now on kindle than they do in hardback. Absolute joke, but all down to the greedy publishers."
Hedgemonkey,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Good screen, great in sunlight and the dark",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 14 June 2019,"So overall pretty good. I had the old Kindle touch which felt antiquated and slow and whilst this one is better it still lacks the responsive touch so many are used to on smart devices. Sometimes I’m not sure I’ve even pressed true screen properly it takes so long to react. I appreciate these are designed to a single purpose but the leap in technology hasn’t teakky been what I expected based on my experiences of Kindle. Great device overall, just don’t expect lightening performance. It is what it is."
Mrs H,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Much needed replacement , fantastic",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 March 2020,"When my old paper-white decided to take a bath in washing machine I was devastated, had to replace ASAP as reading hardback book in bed was danger to health ( hit me in face each time I nodded off).Love these as easy to hold can read in bed without disturbing other half by keeping light on and handy to fit in handbag. This one is supposedly waterproof but the washing machine is definitely a no no.Update - decided i would bin washing machine damaged kindle only to find it now works perfectly, how amazing !"
R O'B,4.0 out of 5 stars,3rd Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 17 April 2019,"Disapointed that the battery life does not live up to expectatios, though i'm not sure what level of use it was calculated on, i got the fast charge plug and that works really well.  Strugling with the fact that when i select for collections on the home page it seems to open the contents of the collection as well, which is not at all what i want.  i often re read books and don't like that i have to scroll through 115 pages etc etc.  love the slimness and light weight though. Added later, i've sorted out how to find collections, so thats ok"
Raymond Morrison,3.0 out of 5 stars,"OK, but not great",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 September 2019,"The device is OK, but the software, when compared to phone, PC, iPad, etc, is poor. It is clunky and not in the least intuitive.When I bought the device, transferring my collections and books was a nightmare. I thought it would happen automatically when I registered the device, but NO. I then spent half a day talking to Amazon support staff getting nowhere. Eventually I transferred everything manually. It took ages, probably half a day.Since then I discovered that the device I bought was the cheaper version with recommendations. Every time I switched on it showed book recomebdations and there was a recommendation banner across the bottom of my home page. All very annoying. Amazon were again unable to help me and I eventually found instruction on the internet and removed the rubbish myself. If you have the same problem, do a search on the internet. You will find easy to follow instructions.The bottom line is, the device is OK, but Amazon support is hopeless; worse than hopeless, because they waste your time when you could either figure it out yourself or get help elsewhere."
Sean B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,A great premium e-reader. Makes reading a joy!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 December 2018,"Things I love:- Invert colours to white on black while reading, though I wish this was easier to enable/disable rather than it being buried deep in accessibility settings.- The new simplified design is MUCH nicer than previous generations, and the flush screen gets a big thumbs up from me. It's nice and comfortable to hold for extended periods.Things that could be improved:- Ability to change sleep screen wallpaper, or just update with some new ones Amazon! Getting bored of seeing fountain pens and pencils all the time. I'm sure this could be easily done with minor regular updates!- Minimum brightness still seems too bright when trying to discreetly read in complete darkness, i.e. in bed next to a sleeping partner."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of my best buys!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 January 2020,"I love my kindle, I’ve been funny about getting a kindle as I love the feel of a book, picking out a new book, turning the page, But after talking to my friend who has a kindle said how good they are, so I went for it and I wasn’t disappointed.  I can actually read quicker as it’s much clearer, reading at night whilst the other half is asleep great too as there isn’t a bright light, books are generally cheaper too. Can’t wait to take it away and not have to carry the books and no struggling to read in the bright sun! It’s a win all round !"
Sugar,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2020,"I had bought one of the original kindles years ago.  This was to replace it. It is as good as and even better than before. Pricey yes, quality and up to the job yes definitely. So easy to use and read anywhere, whether it be in the dark or in the sunlight, holding it is easier as well. No more fiddly keyboard.  It has proved to be a real bonus during lockdown."
Joe Bloggs22,4.0 out of 5 stars,Charger lead not working,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 2 May 2020,"Happy to have my new  kindle, however a little unhappy as the charger lead doesn’t work, wasted a whole day yesterday trying to charge kindle.I’ve had the kindle less than a month, and this would have been my 2nd charge, it did work the 1st time. Have tried online help to get a replacement unsuccessfully, can’t phone Amazon because of the current crisis."
jmiw,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good upgrade,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 January 2019,"This was a present to upgrade from my old version, which was still good. The difference is fairly significant. To read with the previous one I had a case with a light but, the visibility towards the bottom of the screen was only semi lit. The new one with a backlight makes it effortless to read at night and the whole page is evenly visible.The other big difference I notice is the clarity of the print, all the edges are crisp and very easy to read.Really pleased with it and would definitely recommend"
Alison,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect for an avid reader,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 January 2020,"I have been very reluctant to change from proper books to a Kindle - however this was bought for me as a present and I love it.  Perfect for reading  in bed without disturbing the other half by having to put the light on.It's very light, small and easy to hold and use.  The touch screen isn't as sensitive as a phone screen but still absolutely fine.  The waterproof nature means that it's safe to read in the bath! I bought a cover for it as I'm prone to scratching screens and it does the job nicely."
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Unusable after only 18 months. Otherwise fine.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 27 December 2020,18 months in (so out of warranty) and the touch starts going haywire. Flipping pages and making it impossible to use. Contacted support who after running through a reset offered me a 15% discount on a new kindle. Not good enough. Putting aside the cost the electrical waste of having a device like this last only 18 months is disgraceful. My first non touch kindle lasted 7 years and was still usable barring its screen degradation.
Reader,4.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 January 2020,"This is an amended review following the impressive response by customer service in addressing my grievance regarding ads.The device is basically a delight to use, and the screen no longer has that dry granite feel of earlier models, which - depending on whom you asked - ranged from unpleasant to downright unbearable to the touch. No such issues here, though. It’s smooth as glass and ergonomically beautiful.There’s a serious issue, though. The decision to place the on/off button on the bottom of the device is utterly baffling. Forget about leaning the device against something so that you can free your hands and go on reading. On a hard surface at least, the button will be activated and the kindle will reboot.Perhaps this issue would be solved by using a case/ cover, but I expressly don’t want one. This device is compact and light, and a pleasure to handle as is. My older paperwhite sits in a case which adds weight and bulk, and this would greatly detract from the sleek simplicity of this iteration.Please rethink the button placement, designers. It’s in the worst possible place!"
Sue Parks,1.0 out of 5 stars,Does not work,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 April 2020,"I can’t use this, it is either not charging or has another fault.Can I return this?  My last kindle lasted for years, this one has barely been used as it has problems right from the start.I have reported these problems but never been able to get through to get them fixed.If you look at this you will see I have never been able to read any of the books I bought."

Mrs Tys,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brilliant as Expected with All Kindles,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 August 2019,Kindle paper-white tops all the e-readers and has headed the market for many years. This is my 3rd Kindle and they have improved with each generation. This one being waterproof/splash proof is a bonus and even though I do not take it near water it will be great for around the pool on holiday.  Also this is much smaller than the previous kindles and as such much lighter and easier to hold for prolonged time. I have no hesitation recommending this Kindle.

William R. Adams,5.0 out of 5 stars,Be aware there are two versions £10 in price difference. The cheaper one has advertisements.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 June 2019,"This is the first Kindle that I’ve owned and I’m very happy with it. Until now I’d only used an iPad for reading e-books which was way to heavy after using it for elongated periods. Delivery time was super fast and the set up was really easy. The only thing I would point out is that, for those people used to using iOS or Android touch devices, the touch screen and OS is not as smooth and intuitive as either Android/iOS. This is of course a somewhat unfair comparison since the purpose of these devices is different to that of a dedicated e-reader. Overall I would highly recommend the Kindle. It’s light, simple to use and very good value. It has brought me back to reading on a regular basis after a ‘digital hiatus’."
Gill E,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lovely item.  Feels as good in your hand as a book does.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 6 January 2020,"This is my third Kindle, second Paperwhite.  This is slightly smaller than my previous one, but that doesn’t affect the reading quality and it’s much lighter to hold.  Battery life is excellent and it’s indispensable for travelling.  The only downsides are that you still can’t turn off the dictionaries - annoying when you are tired and leave a finger too long on the screen - and the addition of advertising every time you open the Kindle, which again can’t be turned off."
Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,never wanted a kindle...BUT...,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 24 November 2018,"i never wanted a kindle cos i love the feel and smell of a true paper book...however, i purchased one and i am so thrilled with it....lovely weight and size and my favourite thing is that i can invert the text so i now read white writing on black background which stops the tired eye syndrome i get with my eye condition...abso wonderful...and order books is so easy and quick..ty amazon...good product"

Shan,2.0 out of 5 stars,Very poor replacement for older generation kindles,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 September 2019,"This is Kindle number 4 for me and I have to say, I'm disappointed. Battery life is terrible. Transition between pages is clumsy. Magnetic wake-up and switch off doesn't work at all. The lighting is quite glaring and makes my eyes hurt. The power button is far too easily knocked, which then switches the kindle off. I have not had these issues with any of my other kindles. I really would not recommend it. Buy an older generation if you can."
Mr. S. Burnett,4.0 out of 5 stars,Great little gadget for travelling,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 11 November 2019,"Probably one of the best gadgets I have ever purchased - I travel a lot and carrying books is no fun and therefore often avoided - I wish I’d purchased one years ago when studying.The two areas I would like to see improved:- touch screen is a little slow when used to mobile phones and iPads etc- would like to see colour images in the future modelsEdited to 4 stars as not all Kindle Books are compatible with the Paperwhite version, frustrating!!"
J C,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great reading device - ticks all the boxes,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 16 September 2020,I like the lightness and easy handling of this Kindle.Perfect to read in bed comfortably.The adjustable light and white on black option is also useful.Looks nice with the different colour option.Would prefer if  options are numbered in an easier way as difficult to match up screen protectors and cases.Great free subscription of three months Kindle unlimited included with Kindle.
Chamanthi Powell,4.0 out of 5 stars,"small, good backlight, reads like a book",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 20 February 2019,"I've had one of the 1st Kindle's that came out for the past 9 years but unfortunately finally died so I bought this one.  Love the fact that it is smaller, reads very well, has a good backlight so I don't need an extra light to read in the dark.  The only reason I didn't give it a five was because if the Wi-Fi is kept on the battery doesn't last long so I put it in aeroplane mode - this means that it takes longer to download any new items once Wi-Fi switched back on - I had to restart the kindle twice.Hope it lasst as long as my old Kindle!"
Booklover,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love the paperwhite,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 18 November 2018,Yet again a brilliant product from Amazon. Yes there isn't too much difference between this one and the old paperwhite. But the waterproof aspect and the extra memory is a great bonus. It also feels a lot lighter than previous models. Battery lasts about 9 days for me who spends a lot of time reading. The only disappointing thing is the fact that Amazon reduced the price 2 weeks later by £30. Not a very loyal thing to do to those who pre ordered for the release date. Amazon very naughty of you
Ethan Brewerton,1.0 out of 5 stars,Very unresponsive & disappointing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 February 2021,"The Kindle Paperwhite is extremely slow and unresponsive:- Pressing or holding the on/off button never turns it off standby- The 40-second reset only occasionally works- The touchscreen has a lag time of a few seconds when navigating between screens (not on pages)- After moving on from the home page, the images of the book covers are still faintly visibleConsidering the price & reviews I was expecting the Kindle to be useful, but the technology seems outdated and unresponsive. Its as though I'm trying to read a novel on an early 2000 Nokia.I was hoping it'd be a simply switch from books to a Kindle but I'm forever trying to reset this just to read a few extra pages.I'm not sure whether I have a faulty Kindle or they all have these issues, but, as I don't have to reset a physical book to read the next page, I think I'll stick with paperbacks for now."
Kitchenbound,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 1 March 2020,Love my Kindle paperwhite - the battery life has not had long enough for me to comment but the back light is very useful. I am still getting to grips with the way my library is displayed - I'm too busy reading to have spent much time learning the differences between my old Kindle and this new edition. i can confirm that the up grade has been worthwhile and I am very happy to recommend it.
Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,Changed how I read books,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 April 2019,"So I’ve resisted converting to kindle for years...I like a book, that is unless it’s a hefty hardback I need to carry or try and read in bed, or I’m packing 3 or 4 books for a holiday.Benefits- You can highlight text and mark pages to go back to- Read at night without needing a light on- Tones of books in a small device that slots in a bag or airplane seat pocket- Download new books on WiFi- Try samples firstNiggles- navigation needs practice- couldn’t find any punctuation beyond a full stop when leaving a review- prompts you to write a reviewer the end but if not on WiFi tricky to find this prompt again"
RJ,5.0 out of 5 stars,Absolutely love it!,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 30 March 2020,"I have been wanting to read more books but I found that I quite disliked physical books. They're thick, heavy and prone to damage when in my bag. I am a student so my bag is often heavy. This kindle is perfect. It's lightweight and easy to use. the touch screen is quite delayed but i assume that it's because of the mechanics etc, however, works perfectly fine and only use it often when turning pages. I love the built in light, you can adjust it as well. I have read so many books in the space of one month compared to if I were to read physical books. love it and recommend it."
DannyBoy,4.0 out of 5 stars,A great product - just be aware that the slightly cheaper version displays adverts.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 7 September 2019,"I’m a late-comer to the e-reader market so I have nothing to compare this to other than Kindle for iPhone, but I’m very impressed so far! It’s very well thought-out, with great features and functionality, and I love having my entire library in my pocket, wherever I happen to be. My one criticism is that Amazon could have made it clearer that the standard version displays adverts, and that for around £10 more, an ad-free version is available."
Fiona,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fantastic reading experience, very happy",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 July 2020,"I was dubious about moving to an e reader. I need not have worried, this Kindle paperwhite is fantastic, very easy on my eyes, no glare, waterproof, and the battery life is incredible. I bought an amazon cover for mine with a cloth material feel and this makes holding it while reading a plesent experience. I would highly recommend this kindle, don't hesitate!"
MoDancer,3.0 out of 5 stars,A good reader with a major flaw,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 August 2019,"The Paper white is easy to read and has many features which I have still to use.The power button is in the most awkward place. The tendancy is to turn off whilst trying to read. It would have been so much better to place it at the top where there is no chance of accidentally pressing it whilst supporting the weight .While not a heavy item, it is heavy enough to activate the switch.Overall I like the reader and with a little thought during design could have been an excellent reader"
Mr A P Beech,5.0 out of 5 stars,A nifty little thing,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 March 2019,"This is my first e-reader, so I wasn't sure if I was going to take to it over paper. But... as with any good book as soon as you start to read you forget about the packaging and just enjoy the content.As a device, it's great - the display is excellent, being super-clear in all conditions I've used it in so far. It's easy to use and you don't need to be a tech guru to find your way around. For those who want to, there's good features such as the dictionary, comments and community groups.I'm a Prime user, so the content I've downloaded and read so far hasn't cost me anything extra.It's light, and after 3 weeks of constant use and over 1,000 pages read I've still got over 25% battery life remaining.I was hoping to reduce the number of paperbacks I have to free up some shelf space - the Kindle Paperwhite is going to allow me to do that.Recommended."
Rob Kennedy Photography,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent e-reader with back lighting.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 22 October 2020,"I bought this in the Prime Day sale for a great price and I’m delighted I got it.It seems a lot smaller than my old Kindle Touch, but apparently it’s the bezel that has shrunk.Mine is supposed to be the “with Special Offers” version, but if it is they are the most subtle adverts ever as i haven’t seen one yet.The led lighting is great for night time reading, or even daytime in a dull room.Well happy."
Elisha,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pleasantly suprised book nerd,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 January 2020,"I have never been a fan of e books and up until recently I would have stood by those words, although there is nothing better than holding a REAL fresh book in your hands.. the smell of the pages.. the excitement and anticipation of being able to lose your self whilst flicking through those pages ,,to find your self in other worlds,,.. Until you have read every single book that you can find by your favourite author to find out that the last remaining ones that you haven't read are no longer being published and are only available in digital format..... I couldn't bare the thought of having to read books by my favourite authors on my mobile phone or my clunky iPad SO I bit the bullet,, yes ..yes I did,, and as the title states I was rather surprised,, the backlit screen was very easy on the eyes and once I adjusted the brightness to a slightly lower setting it was no different to looking at real pages from a real book. Although I will ALWAYS favour a real book over a digital one, I can honestly say that this really is the next best thing. I now carry it with me every where I go and it saves my beloved books getting scuffed up in my bag because I am one of those women whose bag is always full of a load of unnesscersary shhhh###"
Eliz M,2.0 out of 5 stars,Disappointing purchase for sight impaired person :(,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 9 October 2020,"I am Partially Sighted & had high hopes that with this Kindle I would find reading easier & more books accessible. Unfortunately the menu font is tiny & cannot be increased in size. The font is not black, as it appears in all the pictures, but dark grey. This did not give me enough contrast between the font & screen  to be able to read comfortably. Some of the books I downloaded are not compatible with this Kindle. For example coloured print was shown as pale grey which was difficult even to people with good eye sight."
Shon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Lightweight, needs very little charge! Fab product",Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 23 August 2019,"Love using a kindle! I love books so I wasn’t sure I’d be a convert - but it’s lightweight, perfect to travel with and gets easier to use once you’ve played about for a few hours with it. The light feature is great - no eye strain or brightness, you can also change the font and size to suit which I love! I also like not having to charge it, I can use it for days on end without needing to recharge which is a great feature. My only criticism is the lock button on the bottom of the screen, I tend to accidentally turn it off a lot when I’m using due to holding it with one hand."
Lorie Boylin,4.0 out of 5 stars,Love it,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 28 June 2020,"I have only given it 4 stars as had to send the first one back as the pages flipped forward a few pages without me touching the screen and would go on to dictionary without me touching the screen. I bought another one as was not able to take first one back to shop being shut due to COVID-19 and the next one was amazing as expected. If it was not for this one off fault, i would have certainly given it a 5. Otherwise absolutely love the paperwhite."
Tomas,4.0 out of 5 stars,Why oh why is the power button there?,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 15 July 2019,"Fantastic kindle. I love it. My only gripe is the fact that the power button has been placed on the bottom edge of the Kindle, so fairly frequently whilst I hold the device (supported by a finger) I accidentally turn it off. Next design, please move the button to the top where the kindle never gets held. Quite how the position of that button got signed off is a mystery. Such a simple mistake ruins what would otherwise be a 5 star bit of kit."
Lorraine Williams,4.0 out of 5 stars,Not bad.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 3 October 2020,"Good product, the built in light is much better than my last Kindle. Love the dark feature. Touch screen moves a bit faster than last kindle. Down side is battery doesn't last as long, I've had it now just over a week and have had to charge it twice already. Battery on my last kindle lasted a hell of a lot longer. Have turned down the brightness on both normal and dark will see if that makes a difference."

Roger Lowe,5.0 out of 5 stars,It is a portable library in your pocket.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 February 2019,"The 32gb 10th edition can hold my current library but with ample space to add much more books in the future.Being waterproof is a bonus as I used to worry about my old Kindle getting wet on holiday especially by the pool.It is also quicker to download books with the 4g lite option. I would recommend the new version to anyone with an older Kindle or to some one thinking about buying a Kindle for the first time.It is easier to carry my library in a Kindle than to take paperbacks on holiday which take up valuable weight allowances.It is also handy  to take it on trains,buses,planes and long car journeys. You cannot go wrong if you purchase a kindle."
Ronnie Keir,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this Kindle,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 29 August 2020,"This is a superb little device. I wanted a dedicated reading device rather than reading on a phone or tablet containing additional apps / distractions. I was not disappointed in the purchase of this 10th generation Kindle. Back-light is great, enables me to read in any light conditions, both indoor and outdoor. Small size is perfect for one-handed reading, very light too. Battery life totally fine for me, I read every day and find the device needs charged around once every 7-10 days. Charging via standard cable supplied with device is quick, around an hour from low to full charge. I operate the device mostly in flight mode as once I have downloaded the books I’m reading why would I need to have it connected to WiFi? I believe this helps maintain longer battery life in between charge cycles too. Overall I think it’s a cracking piece of kit :)"
Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,BLUETOOTH FALSE ADVERTISING,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 25 December 2018,"I bought this as a replacement for an older kindle paperwhite, mostly for the ability to listen to audio books. However I was dismayed when trying to connect to my pair of over ear headphones that it couldn't find my device. It turns out that only selective headphones/ earphones that do not have a microphone and a number of other requirements are usable on this device. This was not indicated anywhere beforehand and seems like a MAJOR issue that was over looked.Without this feature I can't justify using this over my new device, the device runs at the same speed and although the screen is better it just isn't enough to justify spending on a new device."
Valerie R.,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 4 August 2020,Love this kindle I love to read so when my Daughter and Husband bought me this for my Birthday I was over the moon. I must admit because I’m of the older generation I had to have help on using it as no instructions with it then I also needed help on how to access the actual books now I know how to use it I’m thrilled with it wish I’d got one years ago.

Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,Decent reader.,Reviewed in the United Kingdom on 8 December 2019,"Still a bit slippy without a case. Bezel still a little large, bookmarking a little hit and miss and slows noticably during reading a large book or multiple series book, but still a great little reader. Be nice if you could listen to music on btooth headphones with it while reading, rather than having to use a second device. Plenty big enough for a little more storage for music, without having to buy a kindle fire!!"
